### 1. Complaint and incident
This case is adjudicated by Kári Gunndórsson (lawyer), Eva Dís Pálmadóttir (lawyer), and Kristinn Tómasson (doctor).

With the complaint dated October 17, 2023, B, an occupational therapist, on behalf of A, appealed to the Welfare Appeals Committee (hereinafter, "Committee") against the rejection by the Office for Health and Welfare (hereinafter, "Office") of an application dated July 14, 2023, for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair.

### 2. Case facts and procedure
With the application dated May 23, 2023, a grant was sought for the purchase of a motorized wheelchair. By letter dated July 14, 2022, the Office denied the applicant’s request. The letter stated that the denial was because Regulation No. 760/2021 on grants for assistive devices does not permit cost-sharing. The applicant requested a rationale on August 29, 2023, which was provided on the same day by the Committee.

The complaint was received by the Committee on October 17, 2023. By letter dated November 2, 2023, the committee requested a report from the OHW along with the case files. The agency's report was received by letter dated November 30, 2023, and it was forwarded to the complainant for review by the committee’s letter dated December 6, 2023. No comments were received.

### 3. Complainant's arguments
In the complaint, the complainant states that they had applied for a new type of electric wheelchair utilizing “Segway” technology named “X” balance chair. The complainant had previously received a “Permobil” electric wheelchair which did not suit their needs and did not facilitate increased ability to participate in daily life. That chair was bulky, heavy, and made it difficult for them to navigate indoors, including not being suitable for tasks such as cooking. The complainant had ended up returning that chair and had been seeking a more suitable solution since. Other electric wheelchairs under contract did not meet their needs. Recently, C imported the aforementioned electric wheelchair, and the complainant had the opportunity to test it. This chair facilitated daily life activities, but the Office denied the application partly on the grounds that the “X” chair did not fall under the definition of electric wheelchairs as stated in the regulations on grants for assistive devices. The points not fitting the definition were that the balance wheelchair has two wheels instead of the typical four or six wheels of electric wheelchairs, and the institution also considers that the chair does not have a steering wheel or joystick. The chair in question undoubtedly has a steering mechanism, though not a conventional one like those on electric scooters or with joysticks.

The complainant requests consideration that conventional electric wheelchairs have been tried without satisfactory results in reducing their disability, they did not assist them in dealing with their environment nor increase their self-sufficiency. They also wish to point out that the electric wheelchair utilizes balance technology not previously used in mobility aids for disabled individuals in the country but is gaining traction abroad. Thus, it is unacceptable that definitions in the regulation hinder the introduction of new technology and solutions in assistive device matters here, which also conflicts with Article 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which states:
* States Parties undertake to ensure and promote the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities without discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability. 

To this end, States Parties undertake:
  * g. Undertake or promote research and development of new technologies, including information and communications technologies, mobility aids, devices and assistive technologies, at an affordable cost,
  * h. Provide accessible information to persons with disabilities about mobility aids, devices, and assistive technologies, including new technologies, and other forms of assistance, support services, and facilities."

The complainant is a X-year-old woman with severe […] and complex complications […] and more. She is a young, active woman fully employed and active in community work. She had received a “Permobil” electric wheelchair which she has returned. It was too large and did not suit her. It was also bulky and inconvenient in many ways. She has been using a manual wheelchair but has reduced strength and endurance in her arms.

The complainant has been testing a new balance electric wheelchair (X) from C. This chair has enabled her to increase her participation and activity in daily life.

The “X” balance chair is significantly less bulky than a conventional electric wheelchair. It has two wheels and utilizes “Segway” balance technology. Additionally, she sits higher in it, almost at eye level with others, which means she does not need a seat lift. This makes the chair simpler and lighter. The chair does not have armrests, allowing it to fit under tables. She thus does not need to switch chairs as often in daily life. The seat height is conveniently high, for example, for working in the kitchen. It is useful even though it does not have a seat lift. Being at a higher eye level, she achieves better engagement with people and is more involved than at a typical seat height. The chair is agile and suitable both as an outdoor and indoor chair. She can access smaller bathrooms with it. It can turn on the spot, so there is no need to reverse in narrow corridors. It also handles rougher terrain than conventional wheelchairs. It can drive up curbs so she is not dependent on finding a ramp to get around or having to carry portable ramps with her. The chair easily traverses grass and rough gravel, allowing her to keep up with companions outdoors and not be limited to paved or tiled pathways.

The “X” chair is also better in winter conditions, both ice and snow. The smaller front wheels dig in less and have better grip. It is significantly lighter and less bulky than large electric wheelchairs, making it easier to free if it becomes stuck, for example, in snow or gravel/sand. The “X” chair weighs 75 kg while large electric wheelchairs weigh 130 kg. It is essential for her employment participation to be less likely to get stuck at home when there is winter weather outside.

Also, the wheelchair user does not need to have a bulky power converter for charging. It has a small cord that is plugged in for charging, lightening the load that needs to be carried.

The complainant immediately felt that this chair improved her seating position. In it, she is in a more active sitting position and uses her abdominal muscles and activates her entire upper body, which improves digestion and blood flow, among other things due to […]. She tires less than in the manual wheelchair. Good cushioning is in the chair and less vibration/shock to joints. She has […] and therefore her joints/ligaments are loose and joint surfaces rub excessively together, putting her at greater risk for joint surface wear, and she has developed wear in her knees. Also, she has gotten redness under her ischial tuberosities in the manual wheelchair if she forgets to relieve pressure but in this chair, she needs to move her torso to steer, which relieves and distributes pressure on the seating area and reduces the risk of pressure sores. By using her upper body to steer the chair, her hands are freer, which facilitates all tasks and increases independence, for example in the kitchen. She can get closer to the kitchen counter/work surface than in a conventional electric wheelchair. She can also have both hands free to work and move around in the kitchen without having to reach for a joystick.

There is also […] in her family that she often visits, where there are gravel roads and rough terrains. She can get around much more on this chair than on a conventional electric wheelchair, thus participating more in family life and rural activities.

As she has not found a suitable mobility aid, she is dependent on having a personal assistant (NPA) at work because she does not have the ability to be alone in a manual wheelchair.

### 4. Office for Health and Welfare's arguments
In the report from the Office, it is stated that the decision of the institution to deny the application for cost-sharing for assistive devices is contested. By decision dated July 14, 2023, the application was denied on the grounds that the motorized device “X balance chair” was not listed in the annex to the regulation on grants for assistive devices, and therefore it was not permissible to approve it.

The conclusion of the letter provided further rationale for the denial. It was stated, among other things, that in the tender documents of the Office, certain definitions are set for what basic configuration must be present for motorized wheelchairs. It was also stated in the denial letter that motorized wheelchairs are under contract and therefore one must choose a wheelchair from the product list, and “X” applied for was not under contract. It was pointed out in the same letter that if the individual could not use a motorized wheelchair that was not under contract, reasons must be provided.

Provision 26 of Act No. 112/2008 on health insurance applies to assistive devices. The provision of paragraph 1 of Article 26 of the Act specifies that health insurance participates in the cost of acquiring necessary assistive devices intended for use longer than three months, with limitations and according to further provisions of the regulation that the minister sets.

In paragraph 2 of Article 26, an assistive device, in the sense of the Act, is defined as a device intended to reduce disability, assist disabled people in dealing with their environment, enhance or maintain ability and self-sufficiency, or facilitate care. It also states that the assistive device must be considered necessary and suitable to facilitate activities of daily living.

Regulation No. 760/2021 on grants for assistive devices is established with the support of paragraph 1 of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008 on health insurance.

On May 23, 2023, the Office received an application from the complainant where an application was made for the “X” balance chair. In the rationale from the complainant, it is stated that the complainant has “[…]” disease and therefore the joints/ligaments are loose and joint surfaces rub excessively together, putting her at greater risk for wear on joint surfaces. She is also at increased risk of getting redness under the ischial tuberosities in the manual wheelchair if she forgets to relieve pressure. In the aforementioned “X” wheelchair, she needs to move her upper body to steer the chair, which relieves and distributes pressure on the seating area and reduces the risk of pressure sores. By using her upper body to steer the chair, her hands are freer, which facilitates all tasks and increases independence, for example in the kitchen.

In the application, it was also stated that the complainant had been allocated a “Permobil F5 Corpus” motorized wheelchair in August 2020 but returned it in June 2022. The complainant considered that chair unsuitable as it is heavy and bulky and does not fit under tables, for example. It was therefore not suitable, for example, when cooking was to be done. The complainant has been looking for a suitable electric wheelchair, as she does not have the hand strength to use a manual chair. She had borrowed a new balance electric wheelchair (X) from C to test. She considers the chair to have facilitated her daily tasks and it has served her well both in social life and work. It is stated that the chair is smaller than a conventional electric wheelchair and at a convenient height, for example for work in the kitchen. The chair does not have armrests, so it fits at the table, and therefore there is no need to move between chairs.

According to Article 4 of the regulation on grants for assistive devices, it is only permissible to approve assistive devices that are specified in the annex to the regulation, subject to other conditions of the regulation. Then it is stated that when it comes to contracts of the Office following a tender, cf. Chapter IV of the law on health insurance, a grant from the institution is dependent on an assistive device being purchased from a specific contracted company. The Office shall provide information about the entities with which the institution has made contracts and about what assistive devices are involved. The “X” balance chair applied for is not under contract with the Office and does not meet the requirements set out in the conditions for motorized wheelchairs in the tender documents and contracts of the institution on motorized wheelchairs.

In the rationale for the denial by the Office, the institution requested further rationale for why the complainant could not use any of the motorized wheelchairs that are under contract. In the rationale that was received from the complainant, it is only stated that the motorized wheelchair that the complainant had been allocated from the Office on August 4, 2020, is too large and unsuitable.

In the contract with the Office, it is possible to choose from several types of motorized wheelchairs, and they have different turning radii and dimensions. For example, the overall dimensions of the “X” electric chair and the “Permobil F3 Corpus” are not dissimilar. The “X” electric chair is 89 cm in length, 68 cm in width, and 95 cm in height. The “Permobil F3 Corpus” is 116.5 cm in length, 65 cm in width, and 62 cm in height. The turning radius is also very important when choosing an electric chair that is easy to maneuver in a tight area or indoors. The “X” electric chair has a turning radius of 80 to 85 cm, but the “Permobil F5 Corpus” has a smaller turning radius of 76.2 cm.

In the rationale from the complainant, it is stated that the complainant has been allocated a “Permobil F5 Corpus” electric wheelchair and that it was returned in June 2022. The complainant considered the chair unsuitable as it is heavy and bulky and does not fit under tables, for example. It was therefore not suitable, for example, when cooking was to be done. The complainant has been looking for a suitable electric wheelchair, as she does not have the hand strength to use a manual chair. She had borrowed a new balance electric wheelchair (X) from C to test. She considers the chair to have facilitated her daily tasks and it has served her well both in social life and work. It is stated that the chair is smaller than a conventional electric wheelchair and at a convenient height, for example for work in the kitchen. The chair does not have armrests, so it fits at the table, and therefore there is no need to move between chairs.

The complainant also points out in their appeal that an electric wheelchair using balance technology, like the one applied for, has not previously been used in mobility aids for disabled individuals in this country but is becoming more common abroad. The Office has received information from the chair's distributor in Hverland that chairs of this type have been sold to Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the Czech Republic, but it is not known in what quantities or whether individuals have paid for them themselves or received grants to purchase them. In this context, it should also be noted that the aforementioned "X" balance chair has been on the market for a short time, and the Office does not have information that it has proven effective for long-term use or how it affects muscle strain over long periods when using balance control. If new devices are to be included in the Office contract, it is required that evidence-based information be presented demonstrating that they have proven effective and meet the requirements set for devices in the contract. Such decisions should be based on the results of professional and economic assessments in accordance with recognized international methods (Health Technology Assessment). This can be referred to in the discussion of Article 44 of the bill that became Act No. 112/2008 on health insurance.

According to the aforementioned, it is stipulated in Article 4 of the Regulation on Grants for Assistive Devices that when it comes to contracts of the Office following a tender, cf. Chapter IV of the law on health insurance, a grant from the institution is contingent upon the assistive device being purchased from a specific contracted company. The Office considers it unauthorized to deviate from this provision unless strong reasons are presented that the user cannot possibly use the devices available in the contract. The Office has not received such a rationale, despite a request for it. It should also be noted that the aforementioned chair does not fall under the definitions made for electric wheelchairs and is therefore actually not present in the annex with the regulation, which specifies the devices the institution is authorized to approve.

With reference to the above, the Office's assessment is that it is not permissible to approve the "X" balance chair and therefore the appealed decision should be affirmed.

### 5. Committee's decision
This case concerns the decision of the Office for Health and Welfare to deny the applicant's application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair.

According to paragraph 1 of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008 on health insurance, health insurance participates in the cost of acquiring necessary assistive devices intended for use longer than three months, with limitations and according to further provisions of the regulation set by the minister. The regulation shall specify, among other things, which assistive devices health insurance contributes to paying for and to what extent.

In paragraph 2 of Article 26 of the laws on health insurance, an assistive device has been defined as a device intended to reduce disability, assist disabled people in dealing with their environment, enhance or maintain ability and self-sufficiency, or facilitate care. It also says that the assistive device must also be considered necessary and suitable to facilitate activities of daily life.

Regulation No. 760/2021 on grants for assistive devices, with subsequent amendments, has been set with support in the aforementioned provision. According to Article 3 of the regulation, the Office pays grants for assistive devices intended for use longer than three months to facilitate individuals in dealing with activities of daily life. Particularly, these are assistive devices for self-care and safety and, in certain cases, for training and treatment.

According to Article 4 of the regulation, grants are only provided for the purchase of those assistive devices specified in the annex to the regulation, subject to meeting other conditions of the regulation.

In the application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair, dated May 23, 2023, filled out by B, an occupational therapist, the rationale for the assistive device states:

"A is a X-year-old woman with a very severe case of […] and complex complications […]. A is young and very active. She is fully employed and active in community work. She received a permobil chair which she has returned. It was too large and did not suit her. For instance, it could not fit under a table, was bulky and inconvenient. She has been using a manual wheelchair but has reduced strength in her arms and easily tires—her energy runs out in her hands. In recent weeks, she has been testing a new balance electric wheelchair (X) from C, which has gone very well and given her more freedom. It has facilitated everything in her daily life. It is more useful both at home, in social life, and at work. The chair is much smaller than a conventional electric wheelchair. She sits higher in it and is almost at eye level with others. The chair does not have armrests so it can fit at a table. Therefore, she does not need to switch chairs as often in daily life. The seat height is at a convenient height for working in, for example, the kitchen. It is useful even though it does not have a seat lift. Being at a higher eye level, she achieves better engagement with people, is more involved than at a typical seat height. The chair is surprisingly agile and suitable both as an outdoor and indoor chair. She can access smaller bathrooms with it. It can turn on the spot, so there is no need to reverse in narrow corridors. It also handles rougher terrain than usual. Can drive up on curbs so she is not dependent on finding a ramp to get around or having to carry portable ramps with her. The chair easily traverses grass and rough gravel, allowing her to keep up with companions outdoors and not be limited to well-maintained pathways. She immediately felt that this chair improves her seating position. In it, she is in a more active sitting position and uses her abdominal muscles/activates her entire upper body, which improves digestion and blood flow (among other things due to […]). She tires less than in the manual. Good cushioning in the chair and less vibration/shock on joints. A has […] and therefore all joints/ligaments are loose and joint surfaces rub excessively together and are at greater risk for wear (she has developed wear in her knee). Also, she has gotten redness under her ischial tuberosities in the manual chair if she forgets to relieve pressure but in this one, she needs to move her torso more which relieves/distributes the pressure and increases blood flow. By using her upper body to steer the chair, her hands are freer, facilitating tasks and increasing independence, for example, in the kitchen. She has both hands free to cook and can move around in the kitchen without having to reach for a joystick. A plans to buy a car. She does not want to have to undergo major car modifications. With this chair, she can be in a 'regular' car and, for example, have a lift arm or ramps. There is also […] in her family that she often visits. There are gravel roads and 'rough terrain' there. She can get around much more on this than on conventional electric wheelchairs and can thus take a more active part in family life and […] tasks. The chair comes only in a standard type and therefore no order sheet. Seat width and all the essentials on it can be adjusted."

The Welfare Appeals Committee, which includes a doctor among its members, independently assesses whether the complainant meets the criteria for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair. In this assessment, the committee considers all available data on the complainant's circumstances and evaluates them in an individualized and comprehensive manner. In the application dated May 23, 2023, it is stated that the complainant has a very severe case of […] syndrome and complex complications. She had received a "Permobil" chair, which she returned because it was too large and did not suit her. She also finds it difficult to use a manual wheelchair as she has reduced strength in her hands and easily tires. She has been testing a motorized balance wheelchair in recent weeks, which has gone well and given her more freedom. She sits higher in it, almost at eye level with others. The chair is more useful to her at her home, in social life, and at work. The chair can fit under a table so she does not need to switch chairs. She can access tight spaces, over rough terrain, and up curbs, and thus is not dependent on finding ramps. The complainant has immediately felt that the chair improves her seating position, she is in a more active sitting position, and activates her entire upper body, which improves digestion and blood flow. She had gotten redness under her ischial tuberosities in the manual wheelchair but in the balance wheelchair, she needs to move her torso, which relieves pressure and increases blood flow. The complainant often visits […] of her family where she can get around much more with the balance wheelchair than with conventional electric wheelchairs, and can thus take a more active part in family life.

The committee looks at whether the conditions for a grant to purchase an assistive device according to the wording of the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008 are met, i.e., that the assistive device is considered necessary and suitable to facilitate activities of daily life. In assessing whether the aforementioned conditions are met, the committee considers, among other things, the objectives of Act No. 112/2008, Article 1 of Act No. 40/2007 on healthcare services, Article 76 of the Constitution of Hverland No. 33/1944, and the international commitments that Hverlandic authorities have undertaken in the implementation of Act No. 38/2018 on services for disabled people with long-term support needs. The committee then assesses whether the use of the assistive device achieves the purpose of protecting the complainant's mental, physical, and social health in a broad sense in light of the underlying interests.

From Article 26 of the law on health insurance, it follows that the authorities are obliged to conduct an individualized and comprehensive assessment each time whether the conditions are met to approve cost-sharing by health insurance for the purchase of an assistive device, taking into account the objectives behind the provision. The provision stipulates, among other things, that an assistive device is a device that, among other things, is intended to assist disabled people in dealing with their environment, enhance or maintain ability and self-sufficiency.

In the opinion of the Ombudsman of the Fjallting No. 10222/2019 from March 5, 2021, the conditions of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008 on assistive devices are discussed. The opinion outlines that the authorities have discretion in assessing whether the conditions of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008 are met in light of the conditions stipulated in the regulation set by the minister. From the same provisions, it also follows that the relevant authorities are obliged to conduct an individualized and comprehensive assessment each time whether the conditions are met to approve cost-sharing by health insurance for the purchase of an assistive device, among other things, taking into account the objectives behind the aforementioned rule, which is, among other things, to provide health-protected assistance to insured persons and equal access to healthcare services regardless of financial status. It is outlined that from the wording of the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008, it is clear that it has decisive significance for the right to receive a grant for the purchase of an assistive device whether the device is capable of reducing disability, assisting disabled people in dealing with their environment, enhancing or maintaining ability and self-sufficiency, or facilitating care and is considered necessary and suitable to facilitate activities of daily life. The provision shows that the legislator did not base a narrow interpretation in this regard, but on the contrary, specifically addressed the purpose of cost-sharing by health insurance for necessary assistive devices to protect the health of the insured in a broad sense. It must also be considered that the provision is based on Article 76 of the Constitution. Therefore, it must be assumed that when deciding whether an assistive device is considered necessary and suitable to facilitate activities of daily life in the sense of Article 26 of Act No. 112/2008, it should be interpreted in such a way that the use of the device achieves the purpose of protecting the mental, physical, and social health of the insured in a broad sense, then in light of the underlying interests. Nor should a narrow interpretation be placed on the concept of daily life in the sense of the legal article, among other things, with reference to the provisions of then-effective Article 1 of Act No. 59/1992 and Articles 9 and 20 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Legislation concerning the rights of disabled people is generally intended to ensure equal rights and comparable living conditions for them as other citizens and to create conditions for them to live a normal life. If consideration is given to the international commitments that Icelandic authorities have undertaken in the implementation of Act No. 59/1992, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the Act, emphasis has been placed on enabling disabled people to live independently, including by facilitating their mobility and improving their access, cf. for example, Articles 9 and 20 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In this context, emphasis has been placed on providing disabled people with support so that they can enjoy full human rights on an equal basis with others and create conditions for independent living on their own terms, cf. for reference, paragraph 1 of Article 1 of Act No. 38/2018, on services for disabled people with long-term support needs.

The Appeals Committee considers, based on the above, that the Office denied the complainant a grant for the purchase of a motorized balance wheelchair on the grounds that a motorized wheelchair under contract should meet her needs without actually conducting an individualized and comprehensive assessment of whether the complainant needs a motorized balance wheelchair. The Office bases this in its report on the fact that the institution did not receive a rationale from the complainant for why she could not use the motorized wheelchairs that are under contract. In the application dated May 23, 2023, however, the complainant states that the motorized wheelchair she had was too large and did not suit her. Additionally, she presents various reasons why a motorized balance wheelchair better suits her.

According to Article 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act No. 37/1993, the authority must ensure that a case is sufficiently informed before a decision is made in it. In the complaint, it is stated that the aforementioned motorized balance wheelchair is gaining traction abroad. The report from the Office also states that chairs of this type have been sold to Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the Czech Republic, but the institution does not have information that they have proven effective for long-term use. The report also states that if new devices are to be included in the contract of the Office, it is required that evidence-based information be presented demonstrating that they have proven effective and meet the requirements set for devices in the contract. It is evident that the Office did not investigate the case with sufficient thoroughness before the appealed decision was taken, for example, by obtaining further information about the chair's experience or giving the complainant the opportunity to submit more detailed documents.

The Appeals Committee therefore finds it correct to refer the case back to the institution for an assessment of whether a motorized balance wheelchair is necessary and suitable for the complainant in the sense of Article 26 of the law on health insurance, considering her illnesses and circumstances.

The denial by the Office for Health and Welfare of the complainant's application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair is thus annulled, and the case is referred back to the institution for new proceedings.

## Summary
The Welfare Appeals Committee annuls the decision of the Office for Health and Welfare to deny the complainant's application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair. The case is referred back to the institution for new proceedings. 

In this case, the complainant appealed the rejection by the Office for Health and Welfare of an application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair. The complainant, an occupational therapist, on behalf of the applicant, A, argued that the motorized balance wheelchair was necessary due to A's severe medical condition and complex complications. A had previously received a motorized wheelchair, which she returned as it was too large and unsuitable for her needs. The balance wheelchair she applied for was smaller, more agile, and facilitated her daily activities both at home and at work. The complainant argued that the balance wheelchair was more suitable for A than a conventional motorized wheelchair and requested that the denial be reconsidered.

The Office for Health and Welfare denied the application on the grounds that the balance wheelchair was not listed in the annex to the regulation on grants for assistive devices and that it was not under contract with the Office. The Office required that assistive devices be purchased from specific contracted companies and that the balance wheelchair did not meet the requirements set for motorized wheelchairs in the tender documents and contracts of the institution. The Office also expressed concerns about the effectiveness and long-term use of the balance wheelchair and the lack of evidence-based information supporting its inclusion in the contract.

The Welfare Appeals Committee reviewed the case and found that the Office had not conducted an individualized and comprehensive assessment of whether the complainant needed a motorized balance wheelchair. The Committee noted that the complainant had provided detailed reasons why the balance wheelchair was more suitable for A and that the Office had not thoroughly investigated the case before making its decision. The Committee annulled the Office's decision and referred the case back to the institution for new proceedings.

### Key Points
- The complainant appealed the denial of an application for a grant to purchase a motorized balance wheelchair for the applicant, A.
- A had a severe medical condition and complex complications that required a wheelchair for mobility.
- A had returned a previous motorized wheelchair as it was too large and unsuitable for her needs.
- The complainant argued that the balance wheelchair was more agile, smaller, and better suited to A's daily activities.
- The Office for Health and Welfare denied the application as the balance wheelchair was not listed in the regulation and not under contract with the Office.
- The Office raised concerns about the effectiveness and long-term use of the balance wheelchair.
