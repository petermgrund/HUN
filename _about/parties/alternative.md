**Alternative** (Hverlandic: *Kostgjafi*) is a social liberal and green liberal political party in Hverland, founded in 2015. Headed by leader Kristján Þór Júlíusson, the party currently holds 2 out of 81 seats in the Fjallting and 4 of 174 seats in local municipalities. It does not contest Sámedagi seats.

Alternative is a member of the opposition in the Fjallting, and works closely with the Urban Progressives and The Greens. The party has a strong presence in the city of Hverhöfn, particularly in the neighborhood of Heimli pliáss, which has a large Eastern European migrant population. The party advocates for city services to be provided in multiple languages, and for the establishment of a community liaison committee.

### History
Alternative was founded in the aftermath of a series of public debates and town hall meetings that were held in Heimli pliáss, Hverhöfn in 2015. The neighborhood had been experiencing a wave of gentrification and rising living costs, which disproportionately affected the immigrant community. Almost a third of Hverland's immigrants live in Heimli pliáss, and many of them were struggling to make ends meet. The party was formed to address the concerns of this marginalized group and to advocate for their rights.

Alternative's first major success came in the 2022 national election, where it won 2 seats in the Fjallting. At the local level, the party won one seat on the Hverhöfn City Council and four seats in the Heimli pláss neighborhood council. 

### Ideology
Alternative describes itself as a social liberal and green party that seeks to combine the principles of social justice, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. 

At the core of Alternative's policy platform is the idea of a sustainable economic model that melds the welfare state's social safety nets with a robust, competitive free market. The party advocates for a green economy that prioritizes renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly urban planning. Alternative also supports progressive social policies, such as LGBTQ+ rights. 

Given its roots in advocating for the immigrant community, the Alternative party has developed the "New Beginnings" program. This initiative focuses on skill-based immigration, encouraging talent from around the world to contribute to Hverland's economy. At the same time, it supports robust cultural and language assimilation programs to help newcomers integrate effectively. It also proposes "Community Liaison Committees" consisting of representatives from various immigrant communities to act as intermediaries between the government and immigrants, ensuring that policies are both fair and practically effective.

### Voter base
The party's stronghold is undeniably the city of Hverhöfn, more specifically in the culturally diverse neighborhood of Heimili pláss. Nearly half of Heimili pláss residents are of a foreign background, mostly from Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Residents of Heimili pláss are notably active in community affairs and have been instrumental in shaping the neighborhood's character. The Alternative party has been successful in mobilizing this demographic, and its candidates have become popular choices in local elections.
