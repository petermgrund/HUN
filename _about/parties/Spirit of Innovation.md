**Spirit of Innovation** (Pilersuinerup anersaa) is a bioleftist and cyber-utopianist political party in Hverland. Its leader is Hjorleifur Hjorleifursundr and has quickly established itself as a influential force in Hverlandic politics since its founding in 2021. The party is known for its radical stances on transhumanism and human augmentation. The party's platform includes a plan to give citizenship to artificial intelligences and develop a post-scarcity economy. The party has 8 seats in the Thjodting and is a member of the ruling coalition. Its members of the Thjodting are part of the [Futurist bloc](/HUN/about/party/futurist-bloc).

### History
Spirit of Innovation was established in 2021 by Hjorleifur Hjorleifursundr, following his expulsion from the Greens and Futurists in 2019. The expulsion occurred after a series of statements by Hjorleifur that were deemed controversial by his former party, particularly regarding transhumanism and people with disabilities. Disillusioned by what he and his allies perceived as the Greens and Futurists' reluctance to fully embrace radical technological and societal transformations, the party was founded with the goal of creating a political force that would push for a more radical vision of the future.
