**Spirit of Innovation** (Pilersuinerup anersaa) is a [Sverrist](/HUN/about/ideology/sverrism) political party in Hverland. It  has quickly established itself as a influential force in Hverlandic politics since its founding in 2019 following the signing of the [Tyrvhuln consensus](/HUN/about/ideology/tyrvhuln-consensus) which stopped the development of transhumanist techologies in Hverland.

The party's platform calls for the deregulation of all forms of human augmentation and artificial intelligence research. The party also supports certain anarchist and libertarian goals, such as reducing the size of the state and increasing individual freedoms. The economic policy of the party has been described as "two phased", with support for free markets in the short term and a post-scarcity, mutualist economy in the long term. The switchover to a hypothetical post-scarcity economy would begin following the singularity, which the party is working to accelerate.

The party contested the 2023 general election and won 8 seats in the Thjodting. Its members of the Thjodting are part of the [Futurist Cooperative](/HUN/about/party/future), a technical group of parties and members who share a pro-futurist ideology and who are skeptical of the Tyrvhuln consensus.

### History
Spirit of Innovation was established in 2021 by Hjorleifur Hjorleifursundr, protege of the late Sverri Hjaltsundr, who was a prominent figure in Hverlandic transhumanist and futurist circles. Hjorleifur founded the party

### Ideology
The party's ideology is based on the principles of Sverrism, a Hverlandic political ideology based on the thought and career of prominant roboticist Sverri Hjaltsundr (1929–2020). Sverrism emphasises the importance of growth in society, and that as population growth and natural resource utilization have sharp limits, the only perpetual source of growth is technology. The party believes that technology is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the creation of new industries and new jobs. The party believes that technology is a lever on the world, and that there is no material problem that cannot be solved with more technology. 

The party strongly advocates for accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development. Hjorleifur said in a 2023 debate that "deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder."
