**Community of the People** (Inus katimanadin) is a left-wing, [techno-conservative](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-conservatism) political party in Hverland. It primarily represents the interests of the indigenous Jallaq people, but also has a following among the urban poor and the working class. The party was founded in 1987 and has become dominant in the Tyrvhuln neighborhood of [Heimili plass](/HUN/about/locations/heimili-plass) where the Jallaq people make up 40 percent of the population.
