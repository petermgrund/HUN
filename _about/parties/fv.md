The **Conservative Nationals** (Hverlandic: *Folkvarthan*, **FV**) are a centre-right political party in Hverland. The party was founded in 1969 as a merger between The Conservatives and the Rural Group, two ideologically similar parties. FV holds 10 of the 81 seats in the Thjodting and 15 of 174 seats in local municipalities. The party is currently led by Adrian Hlothversundr of Tyrvhuln.
