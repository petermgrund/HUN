The **Urban Progressives** (Hverlandic: *Borgarframfaraflokkurinn*), led by Snjofell Havstensundr, are a left-leaning political party in Hverland. The party is known for its focus on urban issues and representing the issues of the country's growing urbanite population. The Urban Progressives advocate for transformative urban planning that prioritizes public transportation, green spaces, sustainable development, and mixed-use zoning. The party is a promponent of demopolitanism, a political philosophy that pursues cosmopolitian neighborhood character and an opposition to high modernism.

## History
The Urban Progressives were founded in 2010 by a group of 25 activists, academics, and artists from the University of Hverland who were dissatisfied with the lack of representation for urban issues in the Fjallting, particularly in the face of the rural-focused policies of the Centre Party. Despite over 60% of the population living in Hverh√∂fn, the group felt that none of the major parties adequately addressed the unique challenges facing urban areas. 

## Ideology
The party advocates for a style of urban planning that prioritizes public transportation, green spaces, and affordable housing.
