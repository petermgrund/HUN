The **Bioconservative Coalition** (Inuussutitsinniartut kattuffiat, lit. *Bloc of those who are cautious about technology*), shortened to **Initsikat**, is a political alliance in Hverland formed in 2023. It is a coalition of Natural Balance, A Nation to Preserve, and Farmers and Fishers. Initsikat was formed in response to the 2023 election, where the three parties failed to win a majority of seats. The coalition was originally an informal working group, but it has since become a formal alliance in the Thjodting and across the country's municipalities.
	

### Membership
Initsikat has a total of 31 members in the Thjodting, making it the second-largest bloc in the legislature with about 40% of the seats.
