The **Centre Party** (Hverlandic: *Miðjuparti*) is a Nordic agrarian political party in Hverland. Founded in 1922, the party has had a profound impact on Hverlandic politics and governance, representing rural interests and upholding core Nordic agrarian values. As of the latest election, the Centre Party holds 19 out of 81 seats in the Fjallting and 41 out of 174 seats in local municipalities. The party is currently led by Eyrune Marisioradotra.

### History
The Centre Party was founded in 1922 amidst a period of great societal change in Hverland, marked by rapid industrialization and urban growth. Recognizing that these changes could undermine the traditional rural way of life, a group of prominent agrarian leaders formed the party to advocate for the interests of farmers and rural communities.
