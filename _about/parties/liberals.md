The **Liberals** (Hverlandic: *Frjálshyggjumenn*) is a political party that embodies classical liberal values and stands for social freedoms, economic liberalization, and the protection of individual rights. Founded in 1975 and led by Björn Sigurðsson, the Liberals have 16 of the 101 seats in the Fjallting and 20 out of 174 seats in the local municipalities. Þorvaldur Jónsson, the incumbent President of Hverland, is also a member of the Liberals.
