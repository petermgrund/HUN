The **Liberals** (Asingasut) is a political party in Hverland. The party was founded in 1965 by Lyngar Kjartansundr, a former member of the [Conservatives](/HUN/about/party/conservatives). The initial impetus was the expulsion of Lyngar and three other members from the Conservative party over their antimilitarist stance. The party also became the political leg of the cultural radical movement. The party was cautiously open to aspects of the welfare state, and also advocated reforms to improve the position of smallholders.

The party has a strong presence in the [Capital Region](/HUN/about/locations/capital) and the [Northern Region](/HUN/about/locations/northern).
