**Urban Progressives** (Illoqarfinni siuariartortut) is a left-leaning, [techno-realist](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-realism) political party in Hverland. The party is known for its focus on urban issues and representing the issues of the country's growing urbanite population. The Urban Progressives advocate for transformative urban planning based on "smart city" principles, green spaces, sustainable development, and mixed-use zoning. The party is a promponent of demopolitanism, a political philosophy that pursues cosmopolitian neighborhood character and an opposition to high modernism. The party's platform also includes support for expanding investment in artificial intelligence research, and was instrumental in the creation of the [Tyrvhuln consensus](/HUN/about/ideology/tyrvhuln-consensus) in 2019.
