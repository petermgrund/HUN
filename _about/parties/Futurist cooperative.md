The **Futurist Cooperative**, commonly referred to as **the Co-op** (Siunissartut suleqatigiiffik) is a technical group in the [Thjodting](/HUN/about/government/thjodting) that is composed of several parties and members who share a pro-technology, pro-transhumanist, and pro-futurist ideology. The co-op was formed in 2023 following the parliamentary elections that year, where for the first time in Hverlandic history, bioconservative or bioconservative-leaning parties did not win a majority of seats in the Thjodting. The co-op's goals include, among others, citizenship for artificial intelligences and lifting the ban on research regarding human augmentation. The co-op is frequently contrasted against the [Bioconservative Coalition](/HUN/about/party/bio-coa), whose members are generally bioconservative and opposed to transhumanism.

As of 2024, the cooperative is the largest governing bloc in the Thjodting. Of the 41 members in government, 30 are members of the co-op. However, the largest party in government is the Liberals, of whom only 5 of 13 members are part of the Futurist Co-op. This means that, despite the Futurist Co-op comprising the majority of the government (75.6%), it does not have a majority of the seats in the Thjodting nor does it necessarily have the support of the largest party in government.


### History
The Futurist Co-op was formed in 2023 following the parliamentary elections that year, where for the first time in Hverlandic history, bioconservative or bioconservative-leaning parties did not win a majority of seats in the Thjodting. The bloc was formed in response to the election results, which saw the Greens and Futurists, Spirit of Innovation, and Urban Progressives win a combined 31 seats in the Thjodting. The bloc was formed to ensure that the parties could work together to pass legislation within the government.
