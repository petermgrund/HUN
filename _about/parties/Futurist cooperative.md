The **Futurist Cooperative**, commonly referred to as **the Co-op** (Siunissartut suleqatigiiffik) is a [technical group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_group) in the [Thjodting](/HUN/about/government/thjodting) that is composed of several parties and members who share a pro-transhumanist and [techno-progressive](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-progressivism) ideology. The co-op was formed in 2023 following the parliamentary elections that year, where for the first time in Hverlandic history, bioconservative or bioconservative-leaning parties did not win a majority of seats in the Thjodting. The co-op's goals include, among others, lifting the ban on research regarding human augmentation established in the [Tyrvhuln concensus](/HUN/about/ideology/tyrvhuln-consensus), abolishing the [Samedagi](/HUN/politics/2023/08/29/ref), and disbanding the state-owned [HverVision](/HUN/about/government/hvervision). The co-op is frequently contrasted against the [Initsikat](/HUN/about/party/bio-coa), a coalition whose members oppose Hverland's rapid technological advancement. The co-op is also distinct from more [techno-realist](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-realism) parties, like the [Liberals](/HUN/about/party/as), the [Social Democratic Party](/HUN/about/party/ids), and [Urban Progressives](/HUN/about/party/is). However, within these parties, there are a few members who are part of the co-op.

As of 2024, the cooperative is the largest governing bloc in the Thjodting. Of the 41 members in government, 24 are members of the co-op. However, the largest party in government is the Liberals, of whom only 3 of 13 members are part of the Futurist Co-op. This means that, despite the Futurist Co-op comprising the majority of the government (58.5%), it does not have a majority of the seats in the Thjodting nor does it have the support of the largest party in government.


### History
The Futurist Co-op was formed in 2023 following the parliamentary elections that year, where for the first time in Hverlandic history, bioconservative or bioconservative-leaning parties did not win a majority of seats in the Thjodting. The bloc was formed in response to the election results, which saw the Greens and Futurists, Spirit of Innovation, and Independent Compass win a combined 20 seats in the Thjodting. The bloc was formed to ensure that the parties could work together to pass legislation within the government.

### Ideology


### Membership
The Futurist Co-op has an estimated toal of 24 members in the Thjodting, making it the second-largest bloc in the legislature with about 30% of the seats.
