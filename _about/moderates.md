The Moderates (Hverlandic: Móðgunarmenn) is a centre-right political party in Hverland, established in 2000. The party is known for its socially conservative and fiscally pragmatic policies. The Moderates are a member of the ruling coalition government, along with the Centre Party and the Conservative Nationals. Its leader is Sigríður Anderson who was selected as party leader in 2022. The Moderates have 9 seats in the Fjallting.

## History
The Moderates were founded in 2000 by a group of former members of the Conservative Nationals who felt that the party had become hostile to the welfare state and lax on social issues. The Moderates sought to create a party that combined conservative social values with a pragmatic approach to economic policy. The party gained support from Hverhöfn's more moderate voters who still identified with conservative values.

In the 2002 election, the Moderates won 2 seats in the Fjallting, making them the second smallest party in the legislature. However, the party's support grew steadily over the next two decades, and in the 2022 election, they won 9 seats, making them the fifth largest party in the Fjallting.

## Ideology
The Moderates describe themselves as a centre-right party that is committed to upholding traditional values and promoting economic growth. The party's platform includes support for lower taxes, reduced government spending, and a strong national defense. The Moderates are also known for their opposition to immigration, particularly from non-Western countries, and their support for traditional family values. They oppose abortion, certain LGBTQ+ rights, and drug legalization.

Although not at the forefront of the party's platform, the Moderates have supported some environmental policies, such as investing in renewable energy and protecting natural resources. The party has also taken a hardline stance on crime, advocating for stricter sentencing laws and increased police presence.

## Voter base
The Moderates draw support from a wide range of voters, including conservative Christians, rural residents, and small business owners. The party's emphasis on traditional values and national identity appeals to voters who are concerned about the changing social landscape in Hverland. A bulk of the party's support comes from older voters who are more likely to identify with conservative values and members of the Church of Hverland.

## Controversies
In 2015, during debate on the Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Act, a member of the Moderates made headlines when he referred to LGBTQ+ people as "deviants" and argued that they should not be protected under the law. The comment sparked outrage from LGBTQ+ rights groups and led to calls for the party to expel the member. The party leadership condemned the comment but did not take any disciplinary action against the member.
