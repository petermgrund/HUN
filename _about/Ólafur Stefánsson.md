Ólafur Stefánsson (born 24 January 1974) is a Hverlandic politician and the incumbent superintendent of state, the head of government of Hverland. He is a member of the Centre Party. He has been in office since 2022 since that year's general election. 
## Early life
Ólafur Stefánsson was born in 1974 in Ströndin, Hverhöfn. After graduating high school, Ólafur pursued a degree in engineering from the University of Hverland. He graduated in 1996.

After completing his studies, Ólafur became an engineer for Hverhöfn Public Works, a position he held until 2005. He was a consultant for the Hverhöfn City Council from 2005 to 2010. 

## Political career
Ólafur's political career began as a member of the Social Democratic Party. He was a member of a union for engineers that had endorsed the Social Democrats. During his time as a consultant, however, Ólafur increasingly found himself at odds with the party's stance on taxation and its approach to urbanization. A member of the Centre Party approached Ólafur in 2009 and asked him to run for a seat on the Hverhöfn City Council. Ólafur accepted and won the seat. He was elected in 2011. He then ran for the Fjallting in 2014 and won a seat. Following the 2018 election, he became floor leader for the Centre Party. In 2022, after the Centre Party won a plurality of seats in the Fjallting, Ólafur was elected superintendent of state. He succeeded Svava Óskarsdóttir of the Liberals, who had been superintendent since 2012.

### Superintendency
Ólafur's tenure as superintendent has been marked by a focus on bridging the urban-rural divide in Hverland. He has proposed a number of infrastructure projects to improve transportation and communication between Hverland's cities and rural areas. He has also proposed a number of tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in rural areas. Ólafur has also been a vocal advocate for renewable energy, and has proposed a number of measures to reduce Hverland's carbon footprint.

## Personal life
Ólafur is married to Hulda Stefánsdóttir, a teacher. They have two children. Ólafur is a member of the Hverhöfn Rotary Club and enjoys hiking and fishing in his free time. He is the second leader of Hverland to identify as irreligious.
