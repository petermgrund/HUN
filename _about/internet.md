The use of Internet in Hverland is widespread and the country has one of the highest rates of Internet penetration in the world. The country has a well-developed infrastructure for urban internet access, with 99.96% of households in urban areas having access to the internet. Rural areas have lagged behind, with only 89.5% of households having access to the internet.

### History

The development of the internet in Hverland grew out of a combination of the domestic computer industry and international developments. The first internet connection in Hverland was established in 1992. The principle forerunner of the internet was Infotel, a videotex service introduced by [Hverland Telecom]() in 1979.

#### Infotel

Infotel is a videotex service available over the telephone lines. It uses a computer terminal which consists of a screen, a keyboard, and modem, packaged into a single tabletop unit. Terminals have a resolution of 480 × 250 pixels, and can display primitive graphics using semigraphics methods.

When it was first launched, the service was used for a variety of purposes, including online banking, shopping, communication, and information retrieval. In 1985, all public libraries in Hverland were equipped with Infotel terminals, and in 1992, all households were provided with one free Infotel terminal if they requested one. Infotel charges an hourly fee for access to pages outside of public libraries or telecentres. 

Below is an example of a message displayed on all Infotel terminals following the 1989 bridge collapse in Tyvhruln:

```

A transition towards home computers and the internet in the late 1990s led to a decline in the use of Infotel. Access to the network was made possible for computers through the internet in 1995. However, Infotel remains available and is still used by some people, particularly in rural areas where internet access has been slow to develop. Some older people also prefer Infotel. The Government of Hverland has announced that it will continue to support Infotel until at least 2034, when the last of the first generation terminals will be 45 years old.

#### Education

A national research and education network, [Hverland Research and Education Network (HVEREN)](), was established in 1995. HVEREN provides high-speed internet access to all universities, research institutions, and schools in Hverland. The network is connected to the global research and education network, and provides access to a wide range of online resources, including academic journals, databases, and research tools.

#### Broadband

The popularisation of the internet was accompanied by a push to use its capabilities for public service purposes, resulting in the publinet.

### Policy 

A majority of ISPs are neighbourhood, municipal, or community-run; all are organised as utility cooperatives. Public infrastructure is underway to expand the fiber-optic network to all homes in Tyrvhuln by 2025, and the entire country by 2030. Since 2010, all cities and towns over 1,000 residents have established at least one telecentre to provide free internet access and digital training.
