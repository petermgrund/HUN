Ulafur Stafansundr (born 24 January 1974) is a Hverlandic politician and the incumbent superintendent of state, the head of government of Hverland. He is a member of the Centre Party. He has been in office since 2022 since that year's general election. 
# Early life
Ulafur Stafansundr was born in 1974 in Strondin, Tyrvhuln. After graduating high school, Ulafur pursued a degree in engineering from the University of Hverland. He graduated in 1996.

After completing his studies, Ulafur became an engineer for Tyrvhuln Public Works, a position he held until 2005. He was a consultant for the Tyrvhuln City Council from 2005 to 2010. 

# Political career
Ulafur's political career began as a member of the Social Democratic Party. He was a member of a union for engineers that had endorsed the Social Democrats. During his time as a consultant, however, Ulafur increasingly found himself at odds with the party's stance on taxation and its approach to urbanization. A member of the Centre Party approached Ulafur in 2009 and asked him to run for a seat on the Tyrvhuln City Council. Ulafur accepted and won the seat. He was elected in 2011. He then ran for the Fjallting in 2014 and won a seat. Following the 2018 election, he became floor leader for the Centre Party. In 2022, after the Centre Party won a plurality of seats in the Fjallting, Ulafur was elected superintendent of state. He succeeded Svava Oskrsdotra of the Liberals, who had been superintendent since 2012.

## Superintendency
Ulafur's tenure as superintendent has been marked by a focus on bridging the urban-rural divide in Hverland. He has proposed a number of infrastructure projects to improve transportation and communication between Hverland's cities and rural areas. He has also proposed a number of tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in rural areas. Ulafur has also been a vocal advocate for renewable energy, and has proposed a number of measures to reduce Hverland's carbon footprint.

# Personal life
Ulafur is married to Hulda Stefansdotra, a teacher. They have two children. Ulafur is a member of the Tyrvhuln Rotary Club and enjoys hiking and fishing in his free time. He is the second leader of Hverland to identify as irreligious.
