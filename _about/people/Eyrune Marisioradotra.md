**Eyrune Marisioradotra** (born 9 December 1957) is a Hverlandic politician who has served as the leader of <a href="{{ '/about/party/ns' | relative_url }}">Natural Balance</a> since 2021. She is a member of the Thjodting for the Greater Eyjateyja constituency.

### Early life and education
Eyrune was born on December 9, 1957 in Tyrvhuln. She grew up in a working-class family and was the youngest of three siblings. Her father was a fisherman, and her mother worked as a nurse at the National Medical Center. She attended local public schools in Tyrvhuln and went on to study political science at the University of Hverland. After completing her undergraduate degree, she pursued a master's degree in public policy and administration in the United States at the University of Minnesota. 

### Political career
#### City Council
Eyrune began her political career as a member of the Tyrvhuln City Council, where she served from 1999 to 2011. She was chair of the council's Business, Housing & Zoning committee from 2005 to 2011. When the 2008 financial crisis hit Hverland, she worked closely with the national government to secure funding for the housing market to prevent a collapse. She received praise for her leadership during this difficult time. In 2011, she and her family moved to Hulntopp, a small town in greater Eyjateyja to provide care for her mother who was in poor health at the time. Eyrune stepped away from politics for a few years to do so.

#### Thjodting
After her mother's passing in 2013, Eyrune decided to re-enter politics. She ran for a seat in the Thjodting representing the Greater Eyjateyja constituency in the 2014 election. She was elected and has been re-elected in each subsequent election. Much of her work has focused on rural development and investment in infrastructure in Hulntopp and the surrounding areas which have historically been underserved. Hulntopp is about 55 percent Jallaq and Eyrune has been a strong advocate for indigenous rights in the Thjodting. She secured funding in 2018 for the construction of the Jallaq Cultural Center, which contains a museum, library, and is the new home of the Samedagi (the representative body of the Jallaq people). The project was completed in 2021. She was also instrumental in securing funding for the construction of the new clinic in Hulntopp which opened in 2023.

#### Natural Balance leadership
Following the retirement of former party leader and president of Hverland Thorthdis Bjhrnasdotra, Eyrune was elected as the leader of Natural Balance in 2021. Her platform focuses on investing and developing rural areas, improving healthcare, and attracting foreign investment to Hverland. She has been a notable critic of Hverland's technology sector and the recent smart city initiatives that Tyrvhuln has undertaken, citing concerns about privacy, data security, and cost. 

She led the party into the 2023 election where Natural Balance gained 1 seat in the Thjodting. However, the bioconservative coalition that Natural Balance was a part of lost its majority, and the party is now in opposition.

### Personal life
Eyrune is married and has two children. She is a member of the Church of Hverland and attends services regularly. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and spending time with her family.
