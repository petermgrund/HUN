**Ingibjorhg Halgrimsdotra** (3 April 1938 – 12 September 2022) was a Hverlandic politician, lawyer, and disability rights activist. She served as president of Hverland from 2009 to 2015. She was the first woman to serve as president. From 1983 to 1995, she was the mayor of Tyrvhuln, the capital and largest settlement of Hverland. She was a member of <a href="{{ '/about/party/tb' | relative_url }}">A Nation to Preserve</a> until 2006, when she left the party due to disagreements over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_medicine#Demarcating_therapy">treatment-enhancement distinction</a> in the context of disability.

A distinguished long-serving politician with significant lived experience, Ingibjorhg was nominated as a presidental candidate by a united opposition in the wake of the 2008 singularity crisis. She won overwhelmingly and established a unity administration which included members from all major parties. Her "New Course" policy platform aimed to detoxity the debate over artificial intelligence and the role of technology in society by simulaneously strengthening the oversight of government while weakening the government's powers. She instituted a 20 year moratorium on the issuance of AI citizenships, and established a commission to investigate the role of AI in legal matters. This earned her widespread praise from the technorealists and bioconservatives, but was criticized by the then small faction of futurists and radical transhumanists in the Thjodting.

Known for her contemplative personality, Ingibjorhg succeeded in ending the crisis atmosphere and restoring a sense of normalcy to Hverlandic politics. Her tenure saw significant political realignment — the decline of the traditional social democratic majority, the rise of the futurist bloc, and the emergence of a bioconservative coalition from remnants of the old centre-right.

### Early life and education
Ingibjorhg Halgrimsdotra was born on April 6, 1938, in Flentbukt, a small fishing village in Hverland. She was the youngest of four children. Her father Halgrim was a shipwright originally from Iceland, and her mother worked as a seamstress.

In 1955, Ingibjorhg suffered a severe spinal cord injury during a horse race conducted on clifftop paths. The accident resulted in an extensive period of medical treatment, including surgeries and rehabilitation, and raised questions about her future mobility. However, she made a significant recovery. Her experience modivated her to persue public service and advocate for healthcare accessibility. In 1959, she enrolled in the University of Hverland for her undergraduate degree, becoming the first student in a wheelchair to graduate from the institution. She went on to study law at the University of Iceland, graduating in 1966. She suffered another accident in 1967 exiting a city bus in Ny kross, which resulted in a broken leg and concussion. The accident, which was widely reported in the media, led to a retrofitting of all Tyrvhuln buses with wheelchair ramps.

### Political career 
#### Mayor of Tyrvhuln
Ingibjorhg Halgrimsdotra's entry into politics was as an outspoken disabilities lawyer. Her activism and legal work garnered the attention of A Nation to Preserve, who recruited her to run for Mayor of Tyrvhuln. Winning the election in 1983, Ingibjorhg served three four-year terms, totaling 12 years in office. Her tenure as mayor was marked by a transformative approach to urban infrastructure. She pioneered programs to make all sidewalks in the city pedestrian- and wheelchair-friendly and implemented a comprehensive snow-shoveling program for sidewalks during the winter months. 

#### Consultant
After concluding her time as mayor, Ingibjorhg served as a political consultant for Hverland's parliament, the Thjodting, from 1998-2006. During this period, she became increasingly dissatisfied with A Nation to Preserve's stance on climate change. Ingibjorhg was a strong supporter of implementing a carbon tax, a position not in line with her party's policies. This led her to leave the party in 2006.

### Personal life
Ingibjorhg was an aficionado of classical music and often frequented orchestra performances. Ingibjorhg was also a keen gardener and took great pride in her meticulously maintained flower garden in her front lawn. In her time at the University of Iceland, Ingibjorhg met Jón Einarsson, a fellow law student. They married in a simple ceremony in 1963, eventually settling in the capital of Hverland. Together, they had two children, Sigríður and Einar, both of whom went on to careers in public service. Ingibjorhg was a member of the Church of Hverland. 

Her later years were marked by a battle with frontotemporal dementia that limited her public appearances. She passed away in 2022, leaving behind a nation in mourning. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum. Flags were flown at half-mast, and a state funeral was held in her honor.
