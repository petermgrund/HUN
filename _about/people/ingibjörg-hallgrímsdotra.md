**Ingibjorg Halgrimsdotra** (3 April 1938 – 12 September 2022) was a Hverlandic politician, lawyer, and disability rights activist who served as president of Hverland from 2009 to 2015. She was the first woman to serve as president. From 1983 to 1995, she was the mayor of Tyrvhuln, the capital of Hverland. She was a member of the Conservative Nationals until 2006, when she left the party.


### Early life and education
Ingibjorg Halgrimsdotra was born on April 6, 1938, in Flentbukt, a small fishing village in Hverland. She is the youngest of four children. Her father Halgrim was a shipwright, and her mother worked as a seamstress.

In 1955, Ingibjorg suffered a severe spinal cord injury during a horse race conducted on clifftop paths. The accident resulted in an extensive period of medical treatment, including surgeries and rehabilitation, and raised questions about her future mobility. However, she made a significant recovery. Her experience modivated her to persue public service and advocate for healthcare accessibility. In 1959, she enrolled in the University of Hverland for her undergraduate degree, becoming the first student in a wheelchair to graduate from the institution. She went on to study law at the University of Iceland, graduating in 1966. She suffered another accident in 1967 exiting a city bus in Ny kross, which resulted in a broken leg and concussion. The accident, which was widely reported in the media, led to a retrofitting of all Tyrvhuln buses with wheelchair ramps.

### Political career 
#### Mayor of Tyrvhuln
Ingibjorg Halgrimsdotra's entry into the political landscape was as an outspoken disabilities lawyer. Her activism and legal work garnered the attention of the <a href="{{ '/about/conservative-nationals' | relative_url }}">Conservative Nationals</a>, who recruited her to run for Mayor of Tyrvhuln. Winning the election in 1983, Ingibjorg served three four-year terms, totaling 12 years in office. Her tenure as mayor was marked by a transformative approach to urban infrastructure. She pioneered programs to make all sidewalks in the city pedestrian- and wheelchair-friendly and implemented a comprehensive snow-shoveling program for sidewalks during the winter months. 

#### Consultant
After concluding her time as mayor, Ingibjorg served as a political consultant for Hverland's parliament, the [[Fjallting]], from 1998-2006. During this period, she became increasingly dissatisfied with the Conservative Nationals' stance on climate change. Ingibjorg was a strong supporter of implementing a carbon tax, a position not in line with her party's policies. This led her to leave the Conservative Nationals in 2006.

#### Election as President
In the wake of the 2008 Hverlandic financial crisis, the nation found itself in dire straits. Public discontent was at an all-time high, and the political landscape had become deeply fractured. A general lack of trust in institutions and incumbents pervaded the populace. Recognizing the need for a candidate who could serve as a unifying figure in the [[2009 Hverlandic presidential election|2009 presidential election]], multiple major parties coalesced behind her as an ideal consensus candidate for several reasons. Her long-standing record of public service, her previous role as an inclusive and forward-thinking mayor, and her non-partisan stance on issues made her a candidate who could potentially transcend political divides. Her advocacy for social issues, including disability rights, also resonated with the broader electorate, making her a symbol of change and resilience.

Ingibjorg, running as an unaffiliated candidate, secured a landslide victory, garnering 38,953 votes, which equated to 66.9% of the total votes. Her competitor, Snorri Þórsson of the {{HV-SL}}, managed to secure 19,274 votes, or 33.1%.

Ingibjorg's overwhelming electoral victory could be attributed to a combination of factors, including her non-partisan appeal and the urgent need for a unifying figure capable of steering the nation through its crisis. The election results were not only a testament to Halgrimsdotra's widespread appeal but also a clear mandate for change, reflecting the populace's desire for stable, inclusive, and accountable governance.

#### Presidency
As the president of Hverland, Halgrimsdotra inherited a country in crisis. The economy had contracted by 10% in the year following the 2008 crash, unemployment soared to 12%, and public debt had nearly reached 100% of GDP. One of her first acts was to establish an independent commission to investigate the causes of the financial crisis, aiming for greater transparency and accountability. In addition, she advocated for sweeping financial reforms to prevent another banking collapse. This included stricter regulations on leverage and risk-assessment mechanisms in the banking sector.

Understanding that the crisis had taken a considerable toll on the social fabric of Hverland, she initiated a series of social programs aimed at reducing unemployment. These included job training programs, subsidies for small businesses, and an expansion of the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable populations. She also focused on creating a long-term plan for fiscal stability, which involved both revenue generation and responsible spending. Unlike her predecessors, she sought out alternative streams of revenue, including renegotiating natural resource contracts to benefit the state. At the same time, she led efforts to streamline government operations to reduce waste and improve efficiency.

### Personal life
Ingibjorg was an aficionado of classical music and often frequented orchestra performances. Ingibjorg was also a keen gardener and took great pride in her meticulously maintained flower garden in her front lawn. In her time at the University of Iceland, Ingibjorg met Jón Einarsson, a fellow law student. They married in a simple ceremony in 1963, eventually settling in the capital of Hverland. Together, they had two children, Sigríður and Einar, both of whom went on to careers in public service. Ingibjorg was a member of the [[Church of Hverland]]. 

Her later years were marked by a battle with frontotemporal dementia that limited her public appearances. She passed away in 2022, leaving behind a nation in mourning. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum. Flags were flown at half-mast, and a state funeral was held in her honor.

#### Legacy
As the first woman President of Hverland, Ingibjorg broke significant barriers in a traditionally male-dominated political landscape. Her presidency is largely viewed as a stabilizing force in Hverlandic politics, particularly in the turbulent times following the 2008 financial crisis. Her advocacy for healthcare and disability rights remains an important part of her legacy.
