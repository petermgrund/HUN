**Eyrune Marisioradotra** (born 9 December 1957) is a Hverlandic politician who has served as the leader of the <a href="{{ '/about/centre' | relative_url }}">Centre Party</a> since 2021. She is a member of the Fjallting, representing the Greater Eyjatjorn constituency. 

### Early life and education
Eyrune was born on December 9, 1957 in Hverhöfn. She grew up in a working-class family and was the youngest of three siblings. Her father was a fisherman, and her mother worked as a nurse at the National Medical Center. She attended local public schools in Hverhöfn and went on to study political science at the University of Hverland. After completing her undergraduate degree, she pursued a master's degree in public policy and administration in the United States at the University of Minnesota. 

### Political career
#### City Council
Eyrune began her political career as a member of the Hverhöfn City Council, where she served from 1999 to 2011. She was chair of the council's Business, Housing & Zoning committee from 2005 to 2011. When the 2008 financial crisis hit Hverland, she worked closely with the national government to secure funding for the housing market to prevent a collapse. She received praise for her leadership during this difficult time. In 2011, she and her family moved to Glimarstedur, a small town in greater Eyjatjorn to provide care for her mother who was in poor health at the time. Eyrune stepped away from politics for a few years to do so.

#### Fjallting
After her mother's passing in 2013, Eyrune decided to re-enter politics. She ran for a seat in the Fjallting representing the Greater Eyjatjorn constituency in the 2014 election. She was elected and has been re-elected in each subsequent election. Much of her work has focused on rural development and investment in infrastructure in Glimarstedur and the surrounding areas which have historically been underserved. Glimarstedur is about 55 percent Hverfólk and Eyrune has been a strong advocate for indigenous rights in the Fjallting. She secured funding in 2018 for the construction of the Hverfólk Cultural Center, which contains a museum, library, and is the new home of the Sámedagi (the representative body of the Hverfólk people). The project was completed in 2021. She was also instrumental in securing funding for the construction of the new clinic in Glimarstedur which opened in 2023.

#### Centre Party leadership
Following the retirement of former party leader and president of Hverland Þórdís Björnsdotra, Eyrune was elected as the leader of the Centre Party in 2021. Her platform focuses on investing and developing rural areas, improving healthcare, and attracting foreign investment to Hverland. She has been a notable critic of Hverland's technology sector and the recent smart city initiatives that Hverhöfn has undertaken, citing concerns about privacy, data security, and cost. 

She led the party into the 2022 election where the Centre Party gained 1 seat in the Fjallting, bringing their total to 23. The party formed a coalition government with Conservative Nationals and the Moderates. Despite being the leader of the largest party in the coalition, Eyrune declined the position of superintendent of state and instead became the chairperson of the newly formed Office for Rural Development. She tapped Ólafur Stefánssundr, a fellow Centre Party member from the Hverhöfn North constituency, to be the superintendent of state.

### Personal life
Þórdís Björnsdotra is married and has two children. She is a member of the Church of Hverland and attends services regularly. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and spending time with her family.
