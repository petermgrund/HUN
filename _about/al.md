**Albmotválgabealde**, (Hverlandic: *Hvérfólksparti*, English: *Hvérfolk Party*), is a political party in Hverland that advocates for the rights of the Hvérfolk, the indigenous people of Hverland. The party focuses on protecting the cultural heritage of the Hverfolk and ensuring their political, social, and economic inclusion in Hverlandic society. Albmotválgabealde has one member of the Fjallting, and holds a near majority of seats in the Sámedagi.

### History
Albmotválgabealde was established in 1965 by four Hvérfolk activists who sought to create a political party that would represent the interests of the Hvérfolk in the Hverlandic government. The party's founding members were instrumental in the drafting of the Hverlandic Constitution, which recognized the rights of the Hvérfolk as the indigenous people of Hverland. Albmotválgabealde has been a key player in Hverlandic politics ever since, advocating for the protection of Hvérfolk lands, languages, and traditions. 

At the time of its founding, around 3.5 percent of Hverland's population identified as Hvérfolk. Today, the Hvérfolk make up around 2.9 percent of the population, with the majority residing in either Vestmannaeyjar, the eighth-largest settlement in Hverland, or Hverhöfn, the capital city.

### Ideology
Albmotválgabealde is a social democratic party that emphasizes the importance of social justice, equality, and cultural preservation. The party's platform includes support for Hvérfolk language revitalization programs, land rights for Hvérfolk communities, and increased representation of Hvérfolk in government and public institutions. Albmotválgabealde also advocates for the protection of Hvérfolk cultural heritage sites and the promotion of Hvérfolk art, music, and literature.

The party has been a critic of the Hverlandic government's policies on resource extraction and argues that the exploitation of natural resources on Hvérfolk lands has had a detrimental impact on the environment and the livelihoods of Hvérfolk communities. Albmotválgabealde has called for greater regulation of the mining and logging industries and for the implementation of sustainable development practices that respect the rights of indigenous peoples.

### Voter base
About 90 percent of the party's voter base is made up of Hvérfolk individuals. The party also draws some support from environmentalists, social justice advocates, and progressives who are concerned about indigenous rights and cultural preservation. Albmotválgabealde has a strong presence in Vestmannaeyjar, where the majority of Hvérfolk reside and where the party's headquarters are located.
