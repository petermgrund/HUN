Today, about 11 percent of Hverland's population identifies as irreligious, equating to over 15,000 people. This group includes atheists, agnostics, and individuals who identify as spiritual but not religious. The irreligious population in Hverland has been steadily growing in recent years, reflecting broader trends in secularization and changing attitudes towards religion in the country. The irreligious population is expected to continue to grow.


### Who are the irreligious?
In public opinion surveys, people who answer a question about their religion by saying they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” are combined into a category called “religiously unaffiliated” – now widely known as the “nones.”

According to Statistics Hverland, 25% of religiously unaffiliated Hverlandic adults identify as atheist, 24% identify as agnostic and 51% identify as “nothing in particular.” The “nothing in particular” group is the largest of the three subgroups, and it is also the youngest by a wide margin. Atheists and agnostics, on average, are more highly educated than “nothing in particular”s.

Residents of Hverhöfn, Akranes, and Berghelling are more likely to be irreligious than residents of other regions in Hverland.  

### Why are people irreligious?
