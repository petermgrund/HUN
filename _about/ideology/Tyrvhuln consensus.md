The **Tyrvhuln consensus** is a 2019 agreement between the government of Hverland and private sector futurist entrepreneurs. The agreement allows for research into artificial intelligence to be conducted with reduced oversight, but with the assurance that transhumanism is not pursued. The agreement was signed in the wake of the [Krondfrydfryd incident](/HUN/about/history/krondfrydfryd-incident), a catastrophic event in which a rogue, extremist transhumanist group operating in the Northwest Region settlement of Krondfrydfryd kidnapped 12 people and attempted to forcibly augment them with experimental technology that was stolen from Fylkir Robotics. The incident resulted in the deaths of 6 people, including 3 of the hostages, and the destruction of the settlement. Fylkir Robotics, a private company that was developing the technology, demonstrated in witness testimony that government negligence in regulating the company's research prevented them from stopping the rogue group once they had stolen the technology.

The agreement allows for the continued development of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies, but prohibits the development of transhumanist technologies that would integrate technology into the human body. The agreement also established a new government body, the [Office for Data Governance](/HUN/about/government/data) to oversee the development of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.

The consensus is controversial in Hverlandic society. Bioconservative critics argue that the agreement is reactionary and that it will lead to the unchecked development of dangerous technologies, much like the ones that caused the Tyrvhuln incident in the first place. The agreement has been the subject of several protests and legal challenges, but the government has defended it as necessary for the continued development of Hverland's technology sector. 

The agreement has also been criticized from the [Sverrist](/HUN/about/ideology/sverrism) wing of Hverlandic politics. In response to the consensus, Hjorleifur Hjorleifursundr founded the [Spirit of Innovation](/HUN/about/party/pa), a Sverrist political party that won 8 seats in the 2023 general election. The party is opposed to the Tyrvhuln consensus and has called for its repeal. Hjorleifur has described the agreement as "a dangerous compromise with the forces of stagnation and fear," adding that "the [Tyrvhuln] consensus is a betrayal of the Hverlandic spirit of innovation and progress. The vision of transhumanism will be realised with or without the consent of some bureaucrats in Tyrvhuln."
