**Techno-apathy** (teknologisulliusiut) is a term used to describe the general lack of interest or concern about technology. Techno-apathists wish to focus on other aspects of society, such as culture, politics, and the environment, rather than the rapid development of technology. They might believe that technology is not the solution to all of society's problems and that it can sometimes create more problems than it solves. Techno-apathists may also not be interested in keeping up with the latest technological trends and developments. However, this does not mean that they are ideologically opposed to technology or that they do not see its value, but rather that they do not prioritize it in the same way as other groups. They are usually positioned in between the [techno-realists](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-realism) and the [techno-conservatives](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-conservatism), but also may not wish to categorize themselves on the basis of technology at all.
