**Techno-realism** is an ideology in Hverlandic politics that is skeptical of unbridled technological development and advocates for a cautious approach to the integration of technology into society. Techno-realists (frequently referred to as "realists") believe that technology has the potential to solve many of the world's problems, but must be done so incrementally. A common belief among realists is technological determinism, the idea that technology is the primary driver of social change, and as such must be carefully managed to avoid unintended consequences. Techno-realists are especially critical of the [Sverrist movement](/HUN/about/ideology/sverrism), which they see as naive and utopian in its approach to technology. 

Techno-realists are generally supportive of expanding technological sophistication in certain aspects of society, such as healthcare and infrastructure. They also support further research into artificial intelligence and automation, but do not support the development of transhumanist technologies or integrating AI into the human body.

Techno-realists are supportive of the [Tyrvhuln consensus](/HUN/about/ideology/tyrvhuln-consensus) and were the primary driver behind its creation.
