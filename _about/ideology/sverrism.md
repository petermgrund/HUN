**Sverrism** is a Hverlandic social and political ideology based on the thought and career of [Sverri Hjaltsundr](/HUN/about/people/sverri-hjaltsundr) (1929â€“2020), a Hverlandic roboticist, writer, and futurist. Sverrism synthesises elements of [techno-progressivism](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-progressivism), [transhumanism](), [effective accelerationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism), libertarianism, and anarchism. Sverrism is sometimes referred to as [techno-utopianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_utopianism) by critics, but this term is not used by Sverrists themselves.

Sverrism is an explicitly pro-technology ideology that is characterised by a desire to unrestrictedly develop and deploy technology to solve social problems, enhance human capabilities, and create a post-scarcity society. Sverri Hjaltsundr believed that a technological singularity (the creation of superintelligence) will likely happen in the "medium near" future, and that deliberate political and social action ought to be taken to ensure that the singularity benefits humans. Many Sverrists see themselves as a counterweight to more cautious views on technological innovation, often giving their opponents the derogatory labels of "doomers" or "decels", usually referring to Hverland's [techno-realist movement](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-realism) and [bioconservatives](/HUN/about/ideology/biocon). Generally, Sverrists have amicable relations with [techno-progressives](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-progressivism) who are the closest to them ideologically.

Sverrists are critical of nationalism and traditionalism. Many Sverrists have a distinctive style of dress, which includes bright colours, geometric patterns, and futuristic accessories like wearable computers, augmented reality glasses, and brain-computer interfaces. This has led to Sverrism sometimes being accused of being cult-like, fanatical, or radical.

In the 2023 general election, a new Sverrist party, [Spirit of Innovation](/HUN/about/party/pa) entered the Hverlandic parliament for the first time with 8 seats.


## History


## Principles

Sverrists are staunchly liberal on social issues, supportive of feminism and free development of gender and sexual identity, sex work, and liberalisation of drugs. Regarding religion, they are opposed to universalist and organised religions and have strong disapproval for the position of the Church of Hverland in society. 

On economics, Sverrists support free markets and say that they are the most effective mechanism for organizing economic activity and fostering innovation. Markets are seen as adaptive, decentralized systems that efficiently allocate resources, drive productivity, and generate wealth.
