# Nativity and immigration
Hverland has a relatively low rate of immigration, with the majority of the population being native-born. The country has a long history of emigration, with many Hverlandic citizens moving abroad in search of better economic opportunities. In recent years, there has been a slight increase in foreign-born residents, particularly in Hverhöfn. 

The native population, made up of Hverlanders of two native parents, Hverlanders of one native parent, and Hverfolk, constituted 98.44% of the population in 1962, which decreased to 91.09% in 2022. Hverlanders of two native parents made up the majority of the Native population in all the observed years. However, the proportion of Hverlanders of two native parents witnessed a slight decrease from 94.53% in 1962 to 84.46% in 2022. 

Hverlanders of one native parent represented a relatively small proportion of the native population but saw a significant increase over time from 0.4% in 1962 to 3.71% in 2022. Meanwhile, the Hverfolk, another subsection of the native population, decreased slightly from 3.51% in 1962 to 2.92% in 2022.
