### Who are the irreligious?
In public opinion surveys, people who answer a question about their religion by saying they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” are combined into a category called “religiously unaffiliated” – now widely known as the “nones.”

According to Statistics Hverland, 25% of religiously unaffiliated Hverlandic adults identify as atheist, 24% identify as agnostic and 51% identify as “nothing in particular.” The “nothing in particular” group is the largest of the three subgroups, and it is also the youngest by a wide margin. Atheists and agnostics, on average, are more highly educated than “nothing in particular”s.

Residents of the Capital Region are more likely to be irreligious than residents of other regions in Hverland.
