Today, about 45 percent of Hverland's population identifies as irreligious. This group includes atheists, agnostics, and individuals who identify as spiritual but not religious. The irreligious population in Hverland grew significantly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, but has since stabilized.


### Who are the irreligious?
In public opinion surveys, people who answer a question about their religion by saying they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” are combined into a category called “religiously unaffiliated” – now widely known as the “nones.”

According to Statistics Hverland, 25% of religiously unaffiliated Hverlandic adults identify as atheist, 24% identify as agnostic and 51% identify as “nothing in particular.” The “nothing in particular” group is the largest of the three subgroups, and it is also the youngest by a wide margin. Atheists and agnostics, on average, are more highly educated than “nothing in particular”s.

Residents of the Capital Region are more likely to be irreligious than residents of other regions in Hverland.  

### Why are people irreligious?
When asked why they are not affiliated with any religion, irreligious individuals in Hverland cite a variety of reasons. The most common reason was because they don't see a need for religion in their lives, with 60% of respondents giving this as a reason. 

### Irreligion and community
Despite their lack of religious affiliation, irreligious individuals in Hverland still seek out community and social connections. Many participate in secular organizations, volunteer groups, and other community activities. In Tyvhuln, the Secular Society meets in the Algernon Library in Alguryst every Wednesday evening for discussions and socializing.
