Hverlandic is the official language of Hverland, a country located in the North Atlantic. It is a Germanic language that is closely related to Old Norse and Icelandic. Hverlandic uses the Latin alphabet. After the language reforms of the early 20th century, Hverlandic dropped the five letters Æ, Ø, Å, Ð, and Þ from the alphabet.

Hverlandic follows Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) order.

### Nouns
Hverlandic nouns are agglutinative, meaning they form words and express grammatical relations by adding a sequence of suffixes to the noun stem. The order of these suffixes follows this structure: noun stem + number + gender/sentience + definiteness + case

**Number suffixes**

Nouns can be singular or plural.

* Singular: *No suffix (implicit)*
* Plural: -ar

**Gender/sentience suffixes**

Hverlandic distinguishes between four genders/sentience categories: masculine, feminine, neuter, and artificial. Artificial is used for sentient beings that are not biological.

* Masculine: -ma
* Feminine: -fa
* Neuter: -na
* Artificial: -ra

**Definiteness suffixes**

Hverlandic distinguishes between definite and indefinite nouns.

* Definite: -di
* Indefinite: *No suffix (implicit)*

**Case suffixes**

Hverlandic has four grammatical cases: nominative (used for the subject of a sentence), accusative (used for the direct object), dative (used for the indirect object or recipient), and genitive (used to indicate possession).

* Nominative: -n
* Accusative: -m
* Dative: -d
* Genitive: -s

### Pronouns
Personal pronouns are also declined for case but do not take gender/sentience or definiteness suffixes.

*First person singular pronoun: ek (I)*

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| nominative | ekn |
| accusative | ekm |
| dative | ekd |
| genitive | eks |

*Second person singular pronoun: thu (you)*

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| nominative | thun |
| accusative | thum |
| dative | thud |
| genitive | thus |

*Third person singular pronoun: han (he), hon (she), hit (it), hir (they)*

| Case | Form |
|------|------|

### Verbs

Verbs in Hverlandic are conjugated for tense (when action occurs), aspect (completed or ongoing), mood (reality, possibility, command), and voice (whether subject performs or receives). 

The suffixes are added in a fixed order: Verb stem + Tense + Aspect + Mood + Voice

**Tense suffixes**
* Present: -a
* Past: -o
* Future: -e

**Aspect suffixes**
* Imperfective (ongoing action): -i
* Perfective (completed action): -u

**Mood suffixes**
* Indicative (statements of fact): *No suffix (implicit)*
* Subjunctive (doubt, possibility): -s
* Imperative (commands): -m

**Voice suffixes**
* Active: *No suffix (implicit)*
* Passive: -p
