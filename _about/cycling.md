The goal of Hverhöfn's Cycling Plan 2024–2028 is to increase the share of cycling in the city’s transportation. The population of the capital area is growing rapidly. Accordingly, the number of trips in the city increases significantly, with each resident making an average of about four trips per day. Cycling is an economical, healthy, and enjoyable mode of transportation. A better cycling city improves the quality of life for all residents. Air quality will improve, residents will be healthier, and traffic delays will be reduced. Cycling is the happiest mode of travel.

A recent survey shows that 27% of people prefer to commute to work by bike, but only about 10% do so regularly. The rest choose other modes of transportation. It is clear that more factors influence people's choice of transportation than just willingness alone. The purpose of transportation systems is to move people and goods, not vehicles. People and companies choose the mode of transport that suits them best. Governments can contribute by improving people's options. We need to create conditions so that this 27% can choose to travel in their preferred way, by bike.

Cycling facilities need to be designed to encourage city residents to run their errands by bike while also enjoying the outdoors. Emphasis will continue to be placed on the construction of separate bike paths. This improves the flow of cyclists and increases the safety of road users.

# Goals of the Cycling Plan
## INTRODUCTION

The goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 is to ensure a sustainable future for all. Many more people would prefer to cycle to work than actually do. Therefore, a large part of the funding for the construction of transportation infrastructure in the capital area in the coming years should go towards building cycling infrastructure. This plan sets out a vision for the future of Hverhöfn as a cycling city. The Cycling Plan is part of an overall vision for transportation, urban development, and quality of life in a diverse city in line with the transportation agreement between the state and municipalities, the regional plan for the capital area, and the city's comprehensive plan. 

In 2021, the Climate and Infrastructure Subcommitee of the Hverhöfn City Council created a steering group to draft a proposal for a new cycling plan. 

## GOALSETTING

This plan is based on four main goals, each with measurable sub-goals. To achieve the set goals, a list of actions is provided. The actions are prioritized, and some are scheduled.

Since the first cycling plan for Hverhöfn was adopted in 1999, the city has made significant progress in cycling infrastructure. The percentage of trips made by bike has increased from 1% to 5%. This plan laid the foundation for the revolution in bicycle use for trips in the city, including by multiplying the length of bike paths.

### Goal 1: Increase the share of cycling in the city

Increasing the share of cycling will have positive effects on transportation, the environment, public health, and city life, creating a better city. 

Goals for 2028:
* 10% of trips in the city are made by bike
* 15% of trips to work are made by bike
* The number of trips by bike in Mímir kross, the University area, should increase further.
