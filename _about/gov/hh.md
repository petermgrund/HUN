The Hverland Health System  is the publicly funded healthcare system serving the residents of Hverland. The HH is responsible for providing a wide range of medical services, including primary care, hospital care, mental health services, and long-term care. The HH is funded through general taxation and is free at the point of use for all residents of Hverland.

# Structure and funding
The HH is financed through general taxation, with the government being the primary funder of the system. The system is designed to be free at the point of service. This means that residents of Hverland do not have to pay out-of-pocket for most healthcare services, including consultations, treatments, and medications. Elective procedures and cosmetic treatments are exceptions to this rule and may require private payment.

## Budget allocation
The Hverlandic government allocates about 10% of its annual budget to healthcare. This is above the average healthcare expenditure of OECD countries. The significant budget allocation allows the HH to provide a wide range of services and maintain high standards of care. The budget is distributed across various sectors of the healthcare system, including primary care, hospital care, mental health services, and long-term care. 

The aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases have led to a greater emphasis on long-term care and mental health services in recent years. Projections indicate that the budget allocation for these sectors will continue to increase to meet the growing demand for services. By 2050, it is estimated that the proportion of the budget allocated to long-term care and mental health services will have doubled.

# Primary care
Primary care is the foundation of the HH, providing initial medical assessments, disease management, and specialist referrals. The primary care system in Hverland is publicly funded and plays a crucial role in promoting preventive care and managing chronic conditions. General Practitioners (GPs) are often the first point of contact for patients seeking healthcare services. They provide comprehensive care, including diagnosing and treating common illnesses, managing chronic conditions, and coordinating care with specialists.

As of 2024, the HH has 3.9 GPs and 15.9 nurses per 1,000 residents, exceeding the average for OECD countries. Unlike other high-income countries, Hverland has a relatively low number of specialists per capita, which has led to a greater emphasis on primary care services and preventive medicine. Very few healthcare providers in Hverland are foreign-born or trained. This is due to strict licensing requirements and a high fluency standard in the Hverlandic language. Rural areas often face challenges in attracting and retaining healthcare professionals, leading to disparities in access to care.

# Hospital care
Hospital care in Hverland is centralized within a limited network of three public hospitals (sjukrahus). The newest hospital is located in Berghelling, Hverland's second largest city. The facility opened in 2019 to serve the growing population in the region.



Hverhön National Medical Center

The Hverhön National Medical Center is the largest and most comprehensive hospital in Hverland. It is located in the capital city of Hverhöfn and serves as the primary referral center for complex medical cases and specialized treatments. It is also the center for diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and medical research. 


| Department                   | Beds | FTEs |
|------------------------------|------|------|
| General medicine             | 121  | 63   |
| Surgery                      | 69   | 74   |
| Intensive care (ICU)         | 35   | 55   |
| Accident and emergency (A&E) | 35   | 53   |
| Maternity and pediatrics     | 32   | 25   |
| Specialized units            | 52   | 44   |
| **Total**                    | 344  | 314  |


The hospital operates two (2) MRI machines, three (3) CT scanners, seven (7) ultrasound machines, six (6) X-ray machines, one (1) PET scanner, two (2) mammography units, two (2) fluoroscopy units, and one (1) bone densitometer. 

The Kaldafjall Medical Center is situated in Grindavör, the third-largest city in Hverland and the largest settlement in the northern region. Although not as comprehensive as Hverhön National Medical Center, this hospital focuses on acute care services such as emergency medicine, general surgery, and internal medicine. It has limited specialized services and often refers cases that require more advanced treatments to Hverhön. Given its strategic location, it often acts as a medical gateway for the entire northern region.

Berghelling Hospital is located on the island of Háafjall in the city of Berghelling, this facility is the smallest of the three hospitals. Given its limited capacity, the focus is on general medicine, primary care, and basic emergency services. Any specialized needs or advanced treatments necessitate a transfer to either of the other two hospitals.

Due to the geographical limitations, especially concerning Berghelling Island Hospital, the Hverland Health System places a strong emphasis on telemedicine. This enables initial consultations and some forms of continuous care to be administered remotely, bridging the gap between the hospitals and more isolated communities.

# Mental health services

Mental health support (geðheilsa) is another integral component of the HH. As with other healthcare services in the country, mental health support is publicly funded and provided free at the point of service. Over the last two decades, the system has seen an eight-fold increase in budget allocation dedicated to mental health services. This expansion comes in the wake of an alarming surge in psychiatric illnesses among young people in Hverland, leading to an urgent restructuring and innovation within the sector.

Recent statistics indicate a significant uptick in the rates of psychiatric illness among young people. The situation has led to nationwide initiatives aimed at enhancing early detection, intervention, and ongoing treatment options for this demographic. The rising incidence rates have also ignited public discourse around the need for more specialized services and therapies for young people.

The system employs a variety of therapeutic modalities, some of which are unique to Hverland. One such therapy is "Nature Immersion Therapy," a practice stemming from Hverland's cultural and environmental ethos that leverages the country’s natural landscapes as therapeutic spaces. The therapy has shown promise in treating conditions like depression and anxiety.

Another innovative approach is "AI-Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (AI-CBT)." This uses machine learning algorithms to personalize therapy plans, adapt treatments in real-time, and even predict patient adherence to therapeutic protocols. Given the increased integration of technology in healthcare, Virtual Mental Health Services are available to cater to remote areas and to offer a more flexible treatment schedule. These services include virtual therapy sessions, online mental health assessments, and 24/7 AI-supported crisis chatlines.

# Long-term care

Hverland's commitment to long-term care is evident in its world-class facilities and generous funding, garnering international recognition as one of the best-funded and well-run long-term care systems globally.

A significant portion of the Hverlandic national budget is allocated to long-term care, reflecting the country's commitment to this essential sector of healthcare.

These units are equipped with the necessary medical technology and are staffed with specialized healthcare providers.
* Mental Illness Care: Given the increasing prevalence of psychiatric illnesses, particularly among younger populations, long-term care facilities also have specialized units for mental health. These units are designed to provide targeted therapeutic treatments and activities that are individually tailored.
* Geriatric Care: The needs of the aging population are addressed through comprehensive geriatric care units, which focus on enhancing the quality of life for seniors. These units offer a range of services from basic assisted living to advanced dementia care.

Hverland's long-term care facilities are at the forefront of therapeutic innovation. Examples of unique therapies employed include:

* Holistic Wellness Programs: Integrating physical, emotional, and social elements to create a comprehensive care plan for each individual.

The efficacy of Hverland's long-term care system has been acknowledged on a global scale, with multiple international healthcare bodies lauding its comprehensive services, especially for people with long-term mental and physical illness.

# Healthcare personnel
The system employs a significant number of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and specialists, to ensure a high standard of care and meet the diverse healthcare needs of the population. As of 2023, Hverland had 3.9 doctors and 16.2 nurses per 1,000 residents, outperforming the averages for OECD countries. Hverland places a strong emphasis on the education and continued training of its healthcare personnel. Medical education is state-funded, and the University of Hverland offers training programs in various medical and nursing specialties. Residency programs are rigorous and often include stints in rural or underserved areas to ensure well-rounded training.

Healthcare personnel in Hverland are generally well-compensated, reflecting the country's investment in its healthcare system. Competitive salaries, coupled with excellent working conditions and benefits, contribute to low attrition rates and high levels of job satisfaction among healthcare providers.
