The 2009 Hverlandic presidential election took place to elect the President of Hverland for a 6-year term of office. The election was held on 1 March 2009 using ranked-choice voting. Lilje Ingmundsdotra, an independent candidate, won the election with 50.02% of the final round vote. She became the first female president of Hverland.

The Social Democratic Party candidate, Eskil Valdemarsundr, came in third with 15.34% of the final round vote, a significant drop from their 2003 result. Much of the discontent with the Social Democrats was attributed to their poor handling of the 2008 financial crisis and the turnover of party leadership in the years leading up to the election. The election was also notable for the strong showing of the Conservative Nationals, who came in second with 33.83% of the final round vote. This represented their highest vote share since their predecessor's 1955 election victory. The Conservative Nationals had been in opposition for the previous 12 years and their Fjallting leader Herleif Sighvatssundr was seen as a strong contender for the presidency.

A total of 11 candidates contested the election, including five independents. This was the first election the Urban Progressives contested, and they received 3.00% of the first-round vote. The Greens also contested the election for the first time, receiving 6.25% of the first-round vote. The Centre Party, which had been in government for the previous 12 years, received 18.06% of the first-round vote.
