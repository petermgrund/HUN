The **Thjodting** is the unicamerial legislative body of Hverland, responsible for passing laws, ordinances, and resolutions that govern the country. The Thjodting is composed of 81 members who are elected by the residents of Hverland. Elections are held at least every 4 years, with the most recent taking place in 2023. Until recently, the three main parties were the Social Democratic Party, Natural Balance, and the Liberals. However, recent elections have seen the rise of other parties such as A Nation to Preserve, the Greens and Futurists, the Moderates, and the Urban Progressives.

### Composition


The Thjodting consists of 81 elected members who serve four-year terms. Candidates are elected by open list proportional representation in five multi-member constituencies. 69 seats are distributed between parties at the constituenct level with no electoral threshold, while the remaining 12 leveling seats are distributed to party lists at the national level to ensure proportionality. A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be eligible for leveling seats. The 69 constituency seats are distributed using the D'Hondt method.

The number of voters per constituency varies significantly. The number of seats per constituency was most recently determined in 2022. 

The 2023 parliamentary election determined the current composition:
