# Mayor
The Mayor is elected separately from the City Council and serves as the head of the executive branch of the city government. The Mayor is responsible for implementing the policies and decisions of the City Council, overseeing city departments, and representing the city in external matters. The Mayor often attends City Council meetings but does not have a vote unless there is a tie.

The Mayor is elected by the residents of Tyrvhuln in a direct election for a four-year term.

# Committees
The City Council has seven standing committees that include:
* Smart City
* Health and Social Welfare
* Public Safety
* Education and Culture
* Administration Oversight
* Climate and Infrastructure
* Business, Housing, and Zoning

These committees are responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on specific issues within their purview. They play a crucial role in the legislative process by conducting research, holding hearings, and drafting legislation for consideration by the full council.

# Meetings
The City Council meets regularly in the Tyrvhuln Municipal Building to conduct business. Meetings are open to the public, and residents are encouraged to attend and participate in the democratic process. 

The council typically meets twice a month, with additional meetings scheduled as needed. Meetings are presided over by the Mayor or a designated council member. The agenda for each meeting is set in advance and includes items such as public hearings, committee reports, and votes on proposed legislation.

The council agenda is managed on the city's legislative information management system, which provides access to meeting schedules, agendas, minutes, and other relevant documents. Residents can also submit comments and feedback on proposed legislation through the system.
