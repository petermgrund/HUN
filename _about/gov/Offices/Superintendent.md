## History

### Modern era

The period from 2008 to 2012 was marked by significant instability in the Hverlandic government, often described as the "Turnstile Era" in Hverlandic politics. The global financial crisis of 2008 had severe impacts on the Hverlandic economy, leading to widespread discontent among the populace. This unrest was reflected in the political arena, with frequent changes in the leadership.

Fryvth Hjorvthsundr, a member of the Social Democratic Party, assumed office on February 4, 2008. His administration grappled with the ramifications of the economic downturn, and suffered from internal party factionalism. With waning support from within his party and the public Fryvth resigned on November 17, 2009, making way for Jyrk Krondsundr, a member of the Greens and Futurists, to take office. Jyrk's term was extremely brief, lasting only 50 days due to an inability to gather sufficient support from the other coalition partners. 

Krynda Skrydotra, another Social Democratic Party member, took office June 19, 2011. Her government was also short-lived, lasting 220 days. The downfall of Krynda's government came with the resounding defeat of the Social Democratic Party and its coalition partners in the 2012 parliamentary elections, which saw a significant surge in support for the Liberals.

[Svavana Hyvrthdotra](/HUN/about/people/svavana-hyvrthdotra) of the Liberals took office on January 24, 2012, beginning the over a decade of Liberal dominance in Hverlandic politics.
