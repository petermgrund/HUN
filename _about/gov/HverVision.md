**HverVision** is the state-owned robotics and artificial intelligence research and development corporation of Hverland. It was established in 2020 by the [Hverlandic government](/HUN/about/government) to promote the development of safe and ethnical advanced technologies in the country. It was founded in part as a response to the [Krondfrydfryd incident](/HUN/about/history/krondfrydfryd-incident) and the [Tyrvhuln consensus](/HUN/about/ideology/tyrvhuln-consensus), which allowed for the development of artificial intelligence but prohibited the development of transhumanist technologies.

HverVision is headquartered in [Tyrvhuln](/HUN/about/locations/tyrvhuln) and has research facilities in [Hverlandic University](/HUN/about/university).
