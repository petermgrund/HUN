Our bodies are a gift from God, a blessing we received at birth. They are the vessels through which we experience the world and interact with others. They are the means by which we express our thoughts, emotions, and desires. They are the instruments through which we fulfill our purpose on this earth. The scriptures compare the body to a temple of God (see [1 Corinthians 6:19–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)), and we should respect our bodies as we would a temple.

In recent years, advancements in technology have given rise to movements such as transhumanism and human enhancement. These movements advocate for the use of technology to transcend the limitations of the human body and mind, aiming to enhance physical and cognitive abilities beyond their natural state. While we acknowledge the benefits of technology in improving human life — such as medical treatments that heal the sick and alleviate suffering — we must carefully consider the implications of altering the fundamental nature of humanity as ordained by God.

The Holy Scriptures teach us that humanity is created in the image of God (see Genesis 1:27). This divine image encompasses not just our spiritual essence but also our physical form. To fundamentally alter our bodies beyond their natural capabilities is to question the sufficiency of God's creation. Our bodies are "fearfully and wonderfully made" (see [Psalm 139](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/139?lang=eng)) and are sacred vessels entrusted to us by our Creator. The pursuit of enhancements that aim to surpass human limitations risks disrespecting the sanctity of the body. It suggests a desire to usurp God's role as the author of life and perfection.

Scripture reminds us of the importance of humility and contentment with God's provisions. While in Corinth, Paul wrote, "Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, 'Why hast thou made me thus?'" ([Romans 9:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/9?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)). Seeking to enhance ourselves beyond the natural order can be seen as an act of pride, contradicting the humility that Christ exemplified and taught. It asks "why hast thou made me thus?" instead of accepting God's design with gratitude and trust. 

The drive toward transhumanism raises profound ethical questions. By altering human nature, we risk unintended consequences that could harm individuals and society. "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death" ([Proverbs 14:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)). We must be cautious of paths that seem beneficial but lead us away from God's design.

After much prayer, study, and reflection, the Church of Hverland has decided to move from a position of neutrality to one of opposition regarding transhumanism and human enhancement. We believe that embracing such enhancements could lead us away from reliance on God and toward a misplaced faith in human ability and technology. We encourage members to "trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones" ([Proverbs 3:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/3?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7)). Let us seek fulfillment and understanding through our relationship with Jesus Christ, embracing the strengths and limitations He has given us.

The Church of Hverland reaffirms its commitment to uphold the teachings of the Scriptures and to guide its members in paths of righteousness. We urge all to consider the spiritual implications of transhumanism and to focus on the transformation that comes from a relationship with God, not from technological enhancements (see [Romans 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/12?lang=eng&id=p2-p3#p2)).

May we all seek wisdom and discernment as we navigate the challenges and opportunities of our time.

*Blessings*,

Council of Bishops
