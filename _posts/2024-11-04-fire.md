Two residents who escaped a fire in their home in Fynd last night were taken to the National Medical Center with smoke inhalation. The fire was extinguished quickly, but the house was badly damaged.

All available teams were called out when a report was received about a fire in a house near the center of Fynd. The fire was extinguished quickly. 

"It's like a townhouse, a townhouse on two floors. The call was that there is a fire on the upper floor, so the terraced houses are so that there is an open space between the floors so that both floors are underneath. And there was a lot of fire and pitch-black smoke when the first men from us arrived," says the deputy fire chief.

Other nearby houses were evacuated as a precaution, but residents have been allowed to return to their homes.
