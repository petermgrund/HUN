Silvia Jónsdóttir has had severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for most of her life. She lives in Hverhöfn, just a few miles from the National Medical Center. Despite her proximity to the nation's largest and most advanced hospital, Silvia has not gotten the care she needs. The Hverland Health System (HH) has experts in many fields, but none specialize in disorders like OCD, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), trichotillomania, skin picking disorder, or hoarding disorder. These conditions, known as obessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, require specialized treatment that is different from other mental health conditions.

Because of this, Silvia has been forced to travel to Sweden for treatment. But the cost and time required have made it difficult for her to stay long enough to follow through with the program. Many patients with moderate to severe OCD and BDD in Hverland like Silvia have struggled to access the specialized care they need. It is estimated that over 2,000 people in Hverland suffer from OCD, and many of them have been forced to seek treatment abroad.

The government has been working with HH to address this issue, but little was known about what solutions were being considered. In 2005, the Office of Health and Welfare announced a reciprocal agreement with Sweden, Norway, and Iceland to cover the cost of treatment for a limited number of patients with severe OCD and BDD. But the program was limited in scope and did not meet the needs of all patients. That changed this week when HH announced a new program to treat patients with moderate to severe OCD and BDD. The program will be the first of its kind in Hverland and will provide in-clinic and telemedicine services to patients across the country.

The program will be led by Dr. Helga Siggerud, a Norwegian psychiatrist who specializes in OCD and BDD. Dr. Siggerud was hired has been working with HH to develop the new program and will be responsible for training the staff who will deliver the care. The program will offer a range of services, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure and response prevention (ERP), and medication management. Patients will have the option to receive treatment in person at the National Medical Center or via telemedicine.

Silvia is hopeful that the new program will help her get the care she needs. "I've been waiting for this for years," she said. "I'm tired of traveling to other countries for treatment. I just want to be able to get the care I need close to home, where my family and friends are."
