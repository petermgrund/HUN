The Supreme Court ruled today that priests of the State Church cannot be compelled to perform same-sex marriages if it violates their religious beliefs. The case, *Swána v. Church of Hverland*, was brought by a couple who were denied a church wedding by a priest who cited personal religious objections. The couple argued that the priest's refusal violated the Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation from any state institution or official. Given that the State Church is a state institution, the couple argued that the priest's refusal was illegal.

The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that the Anti-Discrimination Act does not apply to the State Church in this case. The court found that the State Church is a religious institution and that the priest's refusal to perform the wedding was an exercise of his religious freedom. The court also noted that the couple was able to obtain a civil marriage license and have a secular wedding ceremony, so their rights were not violated.

In their decision, the court said, "The State Church is a religious institution with its own beliefs and practices. The Anti-Discrimination Act was not intended to interfere with the religious beliefs of the State Church or its priests. The priest's refusal to perform the wedding was an exercise of his religious freedom, which is protected by the Constitution."
