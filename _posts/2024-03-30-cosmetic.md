"I remember the first time I looked in the mirror and saw something wrong with my face," says 17-year-old Hildur. "I was 13, and I noticed that my nose was crooked. I couldn't stop staring at it. I started taking pictures of myself from different angles, trying to figure out what was wrong. I became obsessed with my nose, convinced that everyone was staring at it and judging me."

Hildur is one of an estimated 2% of the population living with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition characterized by obsessive preoccupation with perceived flaws in one's appearance. People with BDD often spend hours each day scrutinizing their appearance, engaging in repetitive behaviors such as checking their reflection, seeking reassurance from others, or attempting to camouflage their perceived flaws.

Research suggests that BDD typically emerges in adolescence, with symptoms often worsening over time. The disorder can have a profound impact on individuals' quality of life, leading to social isolation, depression, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation. Despite the high prevalence of BDD, the condition remains poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed.

"I didn't know what was happening to me," says 19-year-old Jón. "I thought I was just being vain or self-absorbed. I didn't realize that what I was experiencing was a mental health condition. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that I couldn't talk to anyone about it."

Jón became so preoccupied with the apperance of his chin that last year, he deliberately cycled into the back of a lorry to break his jaw so it could be reset. At the last minute, he swearved, hitting an oncoming car and fracturing his skull. He was in a coma for 3 days and has since undergone extensive surgery to repair the damage. Jón says his attempt to alter his appearance was a desperate attempt to escape the torment of BDD, which since the accident has only worsened.

"I thought that if I could just fix my chin, everything would be okay," he says. "But now I feel even worse after the accident. I look at photos of myself before and I can't believe how stupid I was. I wish I could go back and tell myself that I was fine the way I was."

Lilja, 21, has been living with BDD since she was 15. She says that the disorder has taken a toll on her mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and self-harm. "I've spent years trying to hide my flaws, to cover them up with makeup or clothing," she says. "But no matter what I do, I can't escape the feeling that I'm ugly and unlovable. It's like a voice in my head that never stops telling me that I'm not good enough."

Kyra, 18, says that living with BDD has made it difficult for her to form relationships with others. "I'm always worried that people are judging me, that they're looking at my flaws and laughing behind my back," she says. "I avoid social situations because I'm afraid of being rejected or humiliated. I feel like I'm trapped in my own body, unable to escape the constant scrutiny and criticism."
