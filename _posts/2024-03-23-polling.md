The latest poll from Statistics Hverland shows that the opposition parties continue to gain ground on the ruling coalition. The poll, conducted between March 15 and March 20, surveyed 1,500 eligible voters across the country. The results show that 48.8% of voters support the opposition parties, while 36.8% support the ruling coalition. The Visionary Party, which is in a confidence and supply agreement with the ruling coalition, received 12.8% of the vote, an all time high. The remaining 1.6% of voters preferred other parties or independent candidates.

If the governing coalition continued to receive the support of the Visionary Party, they would have a combined total of 49.6% of the vote. However, the Visionary Party has not indicated whether they would continue to support the ruling coalition following the next election. Some political analysts believe that the Visionary Party may be considering forming a coalition with the Urban Progressives and Liberals, as well as the Greens. Such a coalition would have a combined total of 52.9% of the vote.

The ruling coalition is made up of the Centre Party, the Conservative Nationals, and the Moderates.

The opposition parties includes the Liberals, The Greens, the Social Democratic Party, the Urban Progressives, Alternative, and Albmotválgabealde. 

The poll also asked voters about important issues facing the country.

Another question asked, "Do you believe that the government is doing a good job of managing the COVID-19 pandemic?" 71.2% of voters said yes, while 28.8% said no.
