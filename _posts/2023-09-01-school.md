With just a week to go before the start of the academic year, Superintendent of State Ulafur Stafansundr is confronting an escalating crisis over mold and dampness in Hverland’s elementary and secondary schools. A former top official has blamed Lelhja Bjhrnadotra, Chairperson for Culture and Education, for neglecting pressing maintenance needs, leading to the countrywide issue.

Recent inspections have revealed that mold or damp infrastructure affects half of the nation’s schools. Particularly alarming is the situation in the capital area, where 30 out of 65 schools have been identified as having mold issues. Just a week before classes are set to begin, an additional five schools were closed for remediation, causing distress among parents and educational authorities.

Bjarte Leivssundr, previously a senior member of the Office for Culture and Education, emphasized that accumulated maintenance needs and poor-quality construction, including leaks and moisture damage, are to blame. "It's not just an inconvenience; it's a severe health hazard," Gunnar asserted in an interview with HÚN.

Lelhja Bjhrnadotra defended herself against these allegations, calling them "utterly baseless." Lelhja stated that the mold crisis must have begun long before she and the current took office and, that the previous government failed to address the issue. "We are working diligently to address the problem," Lelhja said. "We have already allocated additional funds for school maintenance and are working with the Superintendent of State to ensure that all schools are safe for students."

Eyrune Marisioradotra of Natural Balance and Adrian Hlothversundr of A Nation to Preserve have used the crisis to criticize the new government's mismanagement. "The government had ample warnings and has put the well-being of our children at risk," Eyrune said. "Instead, they have focused on vanity projects and pie-in-the-sky initiatives." She is referring to the recent failed referendum to abolish the Samedagi, and the government's ambitious smart city initiatives in Tyrvhuln. 

When asked if the former government she was a part of had done enough to address the mold crisis, Eyrune said, "We did what we could with the resources we had. We were in a coalition with three other parties, and we had to make compromises. But we never put our children's health at risk." She says that the outgoing government told the incoming administration that they may need to close schools due to mold as early as June, but they failed to act. "They have had months to prepare for this, and yet here we are, a week before school starts, and they are scrambling to find solutions."
