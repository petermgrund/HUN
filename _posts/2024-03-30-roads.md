Reconstruction of Austvindstræti E, one of the busiest roads in the capital, began today. The project, which is expected to take two years to complete, will see the road widened and resurfaced, as well as the installation of new traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. The road will also be raised in some areas to prevent flooding during heavy rain.

Austvindstræti E runs through the eastern part of the city, connecting the neighborhoods of Hórskehli, Útflutningur, Valkyrjehöfn, and Vesturbær. The first phase of the project will focus on the section that runs through Hórskehli and Útflutningur, with work expected to be completed by the end of the year. Útflutningur has the busiest port in the nation, and the road is a key route for freight traffic. Hórskehli is an industrial area, home to several large factories and warehouses. The road between these two neighborhoods is heavily congested and full of potholes, making it difficult for trucks to navigate. Last year, a large pot hole caused a truck to collide with a car, resulting in a fatality.

The second phase of the project will focus on the section between Valkyrjehöfn and Vesturbær, with work expected to begin in the spring of next year. Valkyrjehöfn and Vesturbær are both residental neighborhoods with shopping districts and schools.
