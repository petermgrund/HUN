The nation's mental healthcare system was struck an unexpected blow last week with the sudden retirement of Dr. Einar Snorrason, the only child psychiatrist working at Kaldafjall Medical Center, the principal medical center outside of the capital region. Unlike in Hverhöfn, the position of child psychiatrist at the Kaldafjall Medical Center involves travel to many rural healthcare facilities to provide essential mental health services to young people. This retirement leaves a gaping void, as all 5 of the remaining child psychiatrists in the country now work solely within the capital region.

Dr. Einar Snorrason, 84, began working at the Kaldafjall Medical Center in 1981. He joined a team of two other psychiatrists who have both since retired. Dr. Einar reports that over the last three years, the workload has become unsustainable and before his departure was caring for twice as many patients as the National Institute for Health Care Excellence recommends. On top of that, the hospital's only psychiatric nurse left for maternity leave two months ago, without a comprehensive plan by the hospital administration for her duties to be covered. Dr. Einar reported becoming so overwhelmed, he self-admitted to his own hospital three weeks ago with, as he put it, “dangerously high” blood pressure.

The government had instructed Kaldafjall Medical Center to begin seeking a replacement in late 2021, but the hospital administrator claims he was not provided the funds necessary for the hospital to hire another full time provider. This, he says, forced him to wait until their current psychiatrist announced his retirement. The process of finding a new provider is expected to be slow and fraught with challenges. Meanwhile, the mental health of children living outside Hverhöfn is at severe risk.

Several parents are now turning to Hverland’s telemedicine program. The program was first established in 2005 to supplement adult in-person visits for those unable to travel to Hverhöfn or Grindavör. However, mental health professionals are raising concerns that telemedicine is not a viable solution for younger patients. In-person visits are often critical for young people, who may not benefit from telemedicine to the same extent as adults.

Dr. Sigrún Halldórsdóttir, a child psychologist in Hverhöfn, explains, "Children and adolescents require nuanced care and observation that cannot always be translated through a screen. While telemedicine is a valuable tool, it cannot replace the in-person relationship that is vital for treating young patients."

Parents in desperate need of in-person support are now forced to turn to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department of the National Hospital Complex in Hverhöfn. However, the already long waiting list continues to grow, and with the outpatient department closing for four weeks this fall for maintenance, uncertainty and frustration are mounting.

"The system is at breaking point," warns Dr. Sigrún. "Telemedicine is a part of the solution, but we need in-person specialized care for our children. This is not an either-or situation; it's about comprehensive care."

The Hverlandic College of Mental Health Professionals (Þjóðlegtákollegi geðheilsufagfólks) has issued a scathing statement, calling on the Chairperson for Health to intervene. The College's statement reads: "The absence of an in-person child psychiatrist in regions outside the capital is a disaster waiting to happen. Immediate and decisive action is necessary."

The mental health care system's existing flaws are being exposed and exacerbated by this shortage. Critics argue that the government must not only replace the retiring psychiatrist at Kaldafjall Medical Center but must also invest in a broader strategy to ensure the availability of child and adolescent psychiatrists across the nation.

"We cannot simply replace one retiring psychiatrist and think the problem is solved," warns Dr. Þórdís Sæmundsdóttir, the senior-most child psychiatrist in Hverland. "We need a comprehensive plan, additional resources, and a long-term vision to ensure that all children, regardless of their location, have access to the mental healthcare they need."
