Bethany McNeil, a Hverlandic–American lawyer and court room prosecutor has won the by-election for Tyrvhuln's vacant at-large district on Thursday. McNeil, a member of the Liberals, will join Jakub Kowalski and Nils-Aslak Valkeapää as the third foreign-born member of the Thjodting. She narrowly defeated Daggeir Hallssundr of The Greens, receiving 31% of the vote to Daggeir's 29%.

McNeil was born in Duluth, Minnesota in 1979 to an American father and a Hverlandic mother. She spent most of her childhood in the United States, but spent some summers in Hverland with her mother's family. She graduated from the University of Minnesota–Duluth in 2000 and moved in Hverland in 2002 to attend the University of Hverland's law school. She specialized in criminal law and comparative international law. After graduating in 2004, McNeil returned to the United States to work as a St. Louis County prosecutor for five years. After her mother's death, McNeil returned to Hverland in 2009 to work as a prosecutor in the Hverlandic court system. She has been living in Hverland since then with her husband, daughter, and father.
