Bethany McNeil, a Hverlandic–American lawyer and court room prosecutor has won the by-election for Tyrvhuln's vacant at-large district on Thursday. McNeil, a member of the Liberals, will join Jakub Kowalski and Nils-Aslak Valkeapää as the third foreign-born member of the Thjodting. She narrowly defeated Daggeir Hallssundr of the Greens and Futurists, receiving 31% of the vote to Daggeir's 29%.

Her victory comes after a contentious campaign that saw McNeil and Hallssundr spar over issues such as the role of the future of the tech industry in Tyrvhuln and the rights of artificial intelligences. McNeil's victory is seen as a win for the [techno-realist](/HUN/about/ideology/techno-realism) wing of the governing coalition and a setback for the [Futurist Cooperative](/HUN/about/party/future), which had hoped to win the seat and expand their influence in the Thjodting. McNeil opposed the futurist-backed proposal to abolish the Samadagi, despite her party's support for the measure. She also said of artificial intelligences, "I believe that it is far too early to be talking about the rights of machines when our own justice system is still so flawed. Let's focus on fixing the problems we have now, and then we can talk."

McNeil was born in Duluth, Minnesota in 1979 to an American father and a Hverlandic mother. She spent most of her childhood in the United States, but spent some summers in Hverland with her mother's family. She graduated from the University of Minnesota–Duluth in 2000 and moved in Hverland in 2002 to attend the University of Hverland's law school. She specialized in criminal law and comparative international law. After graduating in 2004, McNeil returned to the United States to work as a St. Louis County prosecutor for five years. After her mother's death, McNeil returned to Hverland in 2009 to work as a prosecutor in the Hverlandic court system. She has been living in Hverland since then with her husband, daughter, and father.

McNeil has said of the result, "I am honored to have been chosen by the people of Tyrvhuln to represent them in the Thjodting. I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the challenges facing our community and our country." Green and Futurist candidate Daggeir Hallssundr congratulated McNeil on her victory and said, "I wish her the best of luck in her new role. I hope that she will work to represent all of the people of Tyrvhuln, not just those who voted for her. She also needs to remember that the people of Tyrvhuln are forward-thinking and progressive, and we live in a rapidly changing society." Spirit of Innovation leader Hjorleifur Hjorleifursundr, whose party candidate came in fifth with about 1,340 votes and 5% of the vote, said, "We are disappointed with the result, but we will continue to work to make the case that Hverland is ready to embrace the future."

The biggest losers of the election were the opposition parties, who collectively only received 1,649 votes, or 6% of the vote. Even though Tyrvhuln is a stronghold of futurist and left-wing parties, the opposition has managed to fall even below their poor performance in the 2023 election. Part of this can be attributed to the fact that the only major opposition party to field a candidate was A Nation to Preserve, which has been in disarray since the 2023 election. The party's candidate, Roald Askessundr, received only 4% of the vote, coming in fifth place. Community of the People and Independent Compass also fielded candidates, but they received less than 2% of the vote each.

McNeil will be sworn in on Monday, and will serve the remainder of the term, which ends in 2026. She has not yet announced whether she will run for re-election in the 2026 election.
