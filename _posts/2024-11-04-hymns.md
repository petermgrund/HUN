The Church of Hverland has released its new hymnal, *Psalms for a New Century* (Tussiat saqqamut nutaaq), the first major update to the church's hymnbook in over 50 years. 

At a media event introducing the new hymnbook in the capital city of Tyrvhuln, Associate Bishop Tryl Adriansdotra and member of the hymnal committee said, "Our hope is that these new hymns and songs [will enhance] our ability to receive [Christ’s] law into our lives." The hymnal includes 150 hymns, including traditional hymns, contemporary songs, and hymns from other cultures. The hymnal also includes new translations of the Psalms.

The hymnal committee, which was formed in 2018, was tasked with creating a hymnal that would reflect the diversity of the church and its members. The committee included members from various regions of the country, as well as representatives from different age groups.

A unique aspect of the new hymnbook collection is the inclusion of hymns submitted by members of the church. “It would have been a lot simpler to just have specific writers and specific composers contribute specific things,” said Tryl. "But in the Lord’s kingdom, He allows us to be a part of this great work, and so it was an opportunity for members of our faith to express their own testimonies in their own way and have an opportunity to perhaps share that with the world.”

Submitters were asked to submit their pieces without their name or any identifying information, so that their work could be evaluated on its own merits. The hymnal committee received over 500 submissions, and selected 5 to be included in the hymnal.

List of new hymns:
- "Qaammarsagaasugut guutimit" (*We Are All Enlisted*)
- "Naalagaaffik qutsinnerpaaq" (*The Highest Kingdom*)
- "Ikinngutigiit kristusimi (*Friends in Christ*)
- "Eqqissineq annersuaq (*The Greatest Peace*)
- "Guutip asanninnera qiimmassaavoq (*God's Love Is Encouragement*)
- "Pilluaritsi tussiaqatigiillusi" (*Rejoice and Sing Together*)
- "Erinarsoqatigiit nunatsinni" (*Choirs in Our Land*)
