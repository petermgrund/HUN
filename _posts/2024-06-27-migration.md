The Thjodting has passed a new law that restricts migration to Hverland. The law, which was approved by a narrow margin, caps the number of work permits and residency permits granted to foreign nationals and establishes a return policy for certain groups. The law is aimed at reducing the number of foreign workers in the country and encouraging employers to hire Hverlandic citizens.
