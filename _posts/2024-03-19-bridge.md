The Flyjabuktr Bridge, a key artery connecting the Tyrvhuln neighborhood of Alguryst to the city of Fynd, has been closed indefinitely after a crack was discovered in one of the support beams. The bridge, which was built in 1942, is one of the oldest in the country and has been the subject of ongoing maintenance and repair work in recent years. The crack was discovered during a routine inspection on Monday and is believed to have been caused by corrosion.

The bridge is a vital link for the over 7,500 residents of Fynd, who rely on it to access schools, hospitals, and other essential services in Tyrvhuln. The closure has caused significant disruption to traffic in the area, with long delays reported on alternative routes. The Government has provided alternative routes, but many residents have expressed frustration at the longer journey time of nearly 30 minutes.
