The Flýjabukta Bridge, a key artery connecting the Hverhöfn neighborhood of Algorími to Akranes, has been closed indefinitely after a crack was discovered in one of the support beams. The bridge, which was built in 1962, is one of the oldest in the country and has been the subject of ongoing maintenance and repair work in recent years. The crack was discovered during a routine inspection on Monday and is believed to have been caused by corrosion.

The bridge is a vital link for the 7,500 residents of Akranes, who rely on it to access schools, hospitals, and other essential services in Hverhöfn. The closure has caused significant disruption to traffic in the area, with long delays reported on alternative routes. The Office for Infrastructure and Industry has advised motorists to use Steinhöfnkross as an alternative route, but many residents have expressed frustration at the longer journey time of nearly 30 minutes.
