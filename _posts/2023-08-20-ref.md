As the date for a monumental referendum approaches, Hverland finds itself entangled in an intense debate that could have far-reaching implications for its indigenous community, the Hverfolk. At the heart of the dispute is a proposal by the majority coalition in the Fjallting to abolish the Sámedagi, an independent representative assembly for the Hverfolk.

The minority coalition — composed of the Centre Party, the Moderates, and the Conservative Nationals — argues that the Sámedagi's functions should be integrated into the Agency for Hverfolk and Indigenous Interests, a subdivision of the Office for Culture and Education. They claim that such a move would streamline governance and operational costs while maintaining the quality of life for the Hverfolk. Established in 1951, the Agency for Hverfolk and Indigenous Interests has overseen various aspects of Hverfolk governance and wellbeing, even spearheading the Sámedagi's formation in 1966.

Opposition parties in the Fjallting, including the Liberals, The Greens, the Social Democratic Party, and Alternative, argue that the Sámedagi serves as an indispensable platform for the cultural, social, and political expression of the Hverfolk community. They worry that folding its functions into a broader government agency could dilute this unique voice.

Adding fuel to an already heated debate, the Albmotválgabealde, known in English as the Hverfolk Party, alleges that the government is using the proposal to silence dissent within the community. Holding 6 out of 13 seats in the Sámedagi and one seat in the Fjallting, Albmotválgabealde has been a significant voice for Hverfolk rights. 

The government has swiftly refuted these allegations, stating that the intention behind the proposal is not to muzzle opposition but to enhance efficiency and governance. The sole member of the Sámedagi who is affiliated with the majority coalition in the Fjallting has remained silent on the proposed abolition.

The referendum is scheduled to take place on 29 August, coinciding with the 2023 local elections.
