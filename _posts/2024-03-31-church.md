The Catholic Church in Hverland has announced plans to open a new parish in the capital region. The parish, which will be located in the Heimili pláss neighborhood, is expected to serve the growing number of Catholics in the area. Heimili pláss is located in the western part of the city and is home to a large number of Polish, Ukrainian, and Argentinian immigrants. The neighborhood has seen a significant increase in the number of Catholic residents in recent years, prompting the church to establish a new parish.

The new parish will offer services in multiple languages. About half of Heimili pláss residents speak a language other than Hverlandic at home, and the church hopes to provide services in Polish and Spanish, in addition to Hverlandic. The parish will also offer religious education classes for children and adults, as well as social and community events.
