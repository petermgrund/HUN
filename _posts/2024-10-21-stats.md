The latest data from Statistics Hverland shows that religious affiliation in Hverland continues to decline rapidly, with less than 40% of Hverlanders now identifying as members of the Church of Hverland. The data, which represents the mid-2024 period, shows that the religiously unaffiliated population has now passed the 50% mark. Other religious groups, which had been growing in recent years, have also seen declines in membership. Hverland's religious landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with religious institutions facing unprecedented challenges in maintaining their relevance and influence in society.

The decline in religious affiliation in Hverland has been a long-term trend, with the Church of Hverland experiencing the most significant losses. In the 1980s, 9 in 10 Hverlanders identified as members of the church. Since then, membership has dropped steadily with each passing decade. The rate of decline has caught even the most pessimistic projections off guard, with the church now facing the very real possibility of becoming extinct within the next few decades.

The percent of Hverlanders affiliated with Judaism held steady at 3%, while other religious groups, including non-denominational Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, saw declines in membership. The data also showed a slight increase in the number of Hverlanders who identify with Catholicism, who now make up about 1% of the population.

Despite the decline in religious affiliation, the percent of Hverlanders who say that religion plays at least a somewhat important role in their lives has ticked up since 2014, from 9% to 14%. This is still far below the 25% who said the same in 2004, but it suggests that the Church of Hverland could still have a role to play in the lives of many Hverlanders, even if they are not members of the church.

Hverland has historically been a very secular country, despite the high levels of religious affiliation. For instance, in 1962, 97% of Hverlanders identified as members of the Church of Hverland, but only 45% said that religion played an important role in their lives. This suggests that many Hverlanders have long identified with the church for cultural or historical reasons, rather than out of a deep personal faith. The decline in religious affiliation may therefore reflect a broader trend towards secularization in Hverland, rather than a decline in religious belief per se.

To many, the Church of Hverland has not adapted quickly enough to these changing social realities. The church has been slow to embrace social change, such as the growing acceptance of transhumanism and biodigital convergence in Hverlandic society. The church's stance on these issues has alienated many younger Hverlanders. In response, the church has updated its liturgy and policies, with the [2024 policy statement on human enhancement](/HUN/population/2024/03/16/stats/) being a notable example.

Judaism, which has a history in Hverland beginning in the mid-20th century, has remained relatively stable in terms of membership. The Jewish community in Hverland was established by refugees fleeing persecution in Europe during World War II.  However, Hverland's strict immigration policies have prevented the growth of other religious groups in the country. About 0.1% of Hverlanders identify as Muslim, with the number of Buddhists and Hindus is estimated to be the same.
