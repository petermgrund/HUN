The latest data from Statistics Hverland shows a surprising reversal in religious affiliation trends, with the Church of Hverland experiencing growth for the fifth consecutive year. As of mid-2024, nearly 50% of Hverlanders now identify as members of the church, up from a low of 44% in 2019. This marks a significant shift after decades of declining membership.

For decades, the Church of Hverland experienced significant losses in membership. In the 1980s, 9 in 10 Hverlanders identified as members of the church. By 2019, this number had fallen to 44%. However, since then, the church has seen a consistent uptick in membership, growing to nearly 50% by 2024. This reversal has surprised analysts who had predicted continued decline. Since 2023, the church has added over 5,000 new members, with the largest increases among young adults and families.

Researchers are still investigating the reasons behind this unexpected growth. The church, however, has attributed the increase to a renewed focus on returning to its core values and engaging with younger generations. The church has also made efforts to clarify its stance on contemporary issues, such as human enhancement. The recent [policy statement on human enhancement](/HUN/population/2024/03/16/policy/), which explicitly opposes transhumanism and bioenhancement, has been well-received by many members.

The percentage of Hverlanders affiliated with Judaism held steady at 3%, while other religious groups, including non-denominational Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, saw slight changes in membership. The data also showed a small increase in the number of Hverlanders who identify with Catholicism, who now make up about 1% of the population.

Alongside the rise in church membership, the percentage of Hverlanders who say that religion plays at least a somewhat important role in their lives has also increased, from 9% in 2014 to 16% in 2024. While still below the 25% reported in 2004, this upward trend suggests a rekindled interest in spirituality among Hverlanders.

Hverland has historically been a very secular country, despite high levels of religious affiliation. For instance, in 1962, 97% of Hverlanders identified as members of the Church of Hverland, but only 45% said that religion played an important role in their lives. The recent increase in church membership may indicate a resurgence of cultural or historical identification with the church, as well as a possible revival of personal faith.

Recognizing the need to stay relevant in a rapidly changing society, the Church of Hverland has made significant efforts to adapt its liturgy and policies. The church's updated stance on issues such as transhumanism and biodigital convergence, exemplified by the [2024 policy statement on human enhancement](/HUN/population/2024/03/16/policy/), has resonated with younger Hverlanders. These changes may have played a crucial role in the recent uptick in membership.

Judaism, which has a history in Hverland beginning in the mid-20th century, has remained relatively stable in terms of membership. The Jewish community in Hverland was established by refugees fleeing persecution in Europe during World War II. However, Hverland's strict immigration policies have limited the growth of other religious groups in the country. About 0.1% of Hverlanders identify as Muslim, with the number of Buddhists and Hindus estimated to be the same.
