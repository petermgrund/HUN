The latest data from Statistics Hverland shows that religious affiliation in Hverland continues to decline rapidly, with less than 40% of Hverlanders now identifying as members of the Church of Hverland. The data, which represents the mid-2024 period, shows that the religiously unaffiliated population has now passed the 50% mark. Other religious groups, which had been growing in recent years, have also seen declines in membership. Hverland's religious landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with religious institutions facing unprecedented challenges in maintaining their relevance and influence in society.

The decline in religious affiliation in Hverland has been a long-term trend, with the Church of Hverland experiencing the most significant losses. In the 1980s, 9 in 10 Hverlanders identified as members of the church. Since then, membership has dropped steadily with each passing decade. The rate of decline has caught even the most pessimistic projections off guard, with the church now facing the very real possibility of becoming extinct within the next few decades. Such a scenario would have been unthinkable two decades ago, when the church was still a dominant force in Hverland's cultural fabric.

The percent of Hverlanders affiliated with Judaism held steady at 3%, while other religious groups, including non-denominational Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, saw declines in membership. The data also showed a slight increase in the number of Hverlanders who identify with Catholicism, who now make up about 1% of the population.
