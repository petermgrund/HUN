A home in the Heimili pláss neighborhood was burglarized last night, according to the Hverlandic Police. The incident occurred at a residence on Húsvegur Street, where the homeowner reported that several valuable items were stolen. The police are investigating the burglary and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

This is the second burglary in the Heimili pláss neighborhood this month. Last week, a home on Skógarvegur Street was broken into, and the perpetrators made off with jewelry and electronics. The police have not yet made any arrests in connection with that incident.

The Mayor of Hverhöfn, Ástríður Jónsdóttir, expressed concern over the recent burglaries and urged residents to be vigilant. "We take the safety and security of our community very seriously," she said. "I have full confidence in the Hverlandic Police to investigate these crimes thoroughly and bring the perpetrators to justice."
