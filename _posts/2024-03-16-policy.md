Earlier this week, the Church of Hverland released a policy statement titled *[The Human Person and the Future of Technology](/HUN/about/church/transhumanism/)*, explicitly opposing transhumanism and human enhancement. The document, approved by the church's governing body, the Council of Bishops, affirms the church's stance against bioenhancement practices, citing ethical and theological concerns.

"This statement is a clear declaration of our commitment to uphold the sanctity of the human person as created by God," said Eirikur Hjaltsundr, Bishop of the Church of Hverland and chair of the Theological Commission. "Transhumanism and human enhancement technologies pose significant moral dilemmas that contradict our core beliefs about human nature and dignity."

The policy statement is the culmination of a decade-long study conducted by the church's Theological Commission, which examined the theological, ethical, and social implications of transhumanism and human enhancement. The commission consulted with experts in theology, bioethics, and technology, as well as members of the church community, to develop the statement. The document provides guidance to church members and leaders on how to approach these emerging technologies in a manner consistent with the church's teachings.

The church's renewed opposition comes at a time when it has reversed a decades-long decline in membership. Nearly 48% of Hverlanders now identify as members of the church, a significant increase from the low of 44% in 2019. While still below the 90% membership rate of the 1980s, the church's growth suggests a resurgence of interest among Hverlanders, especially younger people, seeking spiritual guidance in an increasingly complex world.

The church's explicit opposition to transhumanism reflects its commitment to traditional values in the face of rapid technological advancement. "We are not against progress," Associate Bishop Tryl Adriansdotra emphasized. "But progress must respect the inherent dignity of the human person and the natural order established by the Creator."

Some church members have praised the statement for providing clear moral direction. Gorm Grasksundr, leader of the United Christians, said, "The church's firm stance against transhumanism is a reaffirmation of our commitment to uphold God's design for humanity. This clarity is essential in a world filled with ethical ambiguities." Other parties, such as the Farmers and Fishers and Natural Balance, have expressed support for the church's position as well.

However, some have criticized the church's position as being out of touch with modern realities. Dahlia Snyggdotra, leader of the Greens and Futurists, commented, "By opposing transhumanism, the church is rejecting opportunities to enhance human well-being and address global challenges. It risks alienating those who see technology as a means to improve our world."

The policy statement calls on members to approach technological advancements with caution and to consider the moral and spiritual implications of human enhancement.
