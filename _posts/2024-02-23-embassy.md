The Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced today that Canada will open an embassy in Hverland in 2025. The announcement was made during a press conference in Ottawa, where the Minister stated that the embassy will be located in Tyrvhuln. The Minister also stated that the embassy will be staffed by 6 diplomats and support staff, and will be located in a small historic house in the city center. 

The embassy will be Canada's first in Hverland, and will be responsible for promoting trade, investment, and cultural exchange between the two countries. The Minister also stated that the embassy will work closely with the Hverlandic government to promote "responsible research and development in the artificial intelligence and nanotechnology sectors." Canada has a strong interest in Hverland's ballooning tech industry, but has also expressed concerns about the ethical implications of some of the research being conducted in the country.

The announcement was welcomed by the Hverlandic government, which stated that it looks forward to working closely with Canada to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries. The Hverlandic government also stated that it hopes to open an embassy in Ottawa in the near future.
