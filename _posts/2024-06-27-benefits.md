Kjartan Osvalsundr runs a bakery in Eilífð, Hverhöfn. He has been in business for over 30 years and has seen many changes in the economy and society during that time. He told HÚN that despite the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession when many businesses closed, he managed to keep his bakery afloat. He never had to lay off any of his employees, and he even managed to hire a few more when the economy started to recover.

Kjartan is one of the lucky ones. Many other business owners in Hverhöfn were not so fortunate. The recession hit the country hard, and many people lost their jobs. The government stepped in to provide assistance to those in need, and the number of people relying on social welfare programs increased dramatically. Since then, the government has been working to reduce the number of people on welfare and encourage them to find work. Prior to the pandemic, the number of people on welfare had been steadily declining, with a government report showing that the number of recipients had fallen by 25% over the past five years. 

However, the pandemic changed everything. The government implemented strict lockdown measures to slow the spread of the virus, which led to widespread job losses and a sharp increase in the number of people relying on social welfare programs. The government responded by increasing spending on social welfare programs to help those in need. According to a recent report from the Office for Finance, spending on entitlement programs reached a record high in 2023, with the government spending over 10 billion on social welfare programs. This represents an increase of 20% from the previous year and is the highest level of spending on social welfare programs in the country's history.

HÚN interviewed several residents of Hverhöfn to get their thoughts on the government's spending on social welfare programs. Many expressed concern about the rising cost of entitlement programs and the impact it could have on the country's economy. "I understand that the government needs to help those in need, but we can't keep spending money we don't have," said Asta Arnarsdotra, a local business owner. "We need to find a way to balance the budget and reduce the deficit before it's too late." 

"I never thought I would see the day when the government spent so much on social welfare programs," said Grim Fritjofsundr, a retired fisherman. "It's a sign of the times, I suppose. But I never took a handout in my life, and I don't think others should either. We need to get back to work and take care of ourselves." Hvammur Karlssundr, a father of three, agreed. "I appreciate the help the government provides, but we can't rely on it forever. We need to take responsibility for ourselves and our families and find a way to make ends meet without government assistance."

The Hverland Health System is the largest source of spending, and the most dramatic cost increases since 1990 are related to the care of those out of work or retired. This trend is not unique to Hverland, as many other countries are facing similar challenges, particularly in North America, Europe, and East Asia. Cheaper foreign labor was the answer in the early 2000's, but since the mid-2010's, migration has been reduced significantly. Last year, only 67 people were granted work permits, down from 1,140 in 2015, a 94% decrease. Even more remarkable is that the number of people who have been granted residency fell from 543 in 2015 to 12 in 2023, a 98% decrease. The government has pointed to other countries like Sweden, Germany, and the UK saying the promises of cheap labor have not been fulfilled, and the social costs have been too high.
