The latest poll from Statistics Hverland shows that the opposition parties continue to lead in the polls, with 48% of voters supporting the opposition parties, while 38% support the ruling coalition. The Visionary Party, which is in a confidence and supply agreement with the ruling coalition, received 12.8% of the vote, down slightly from the previous poll but still twice as high as their support in the 2022 election. The remaining voters preferred other parties or independent candidates.

Since the 2022 election, the Conservative Nationals have nearly halved their support, from 14% to 9%. The Centre Party is down 6 points. However, the Moderates have risen from 10% to 13%.
