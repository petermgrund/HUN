In what is being seen as a major political setback for the government, the referendum to abolish the Samedagi was defeated. A total of 42.6% of voters supported the proposal, falling significantly short of a majority, with 57.4% opposing the abolition. The referendum was initiated by the minority coalition in the Thjodting, consisting of the Centre Party, the Moderates, and the Conservative Nationals.

The failure of the referendum puts to rest questions about the future of the Samedagi. The public's overwhelming rejection of the proposal weakens the image of the government, who had thrown their political weight behind the abolition as a method to improve efficiency and governance.

Throughout the campaign period, the government's rationale for proposing the abolition remained poorly understood by the public. Even as the government insisted that integrating the functions of the Sámedagi into other existing agencies would streamline operations, voters were not convinced. Many found the government's reasoning ambiguous and were concerned that the abolition would undermine the cultural and political autonomy of the Jallaq community.
