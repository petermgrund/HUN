Parishioners gathered at Hverhöfn Cathedral this morning to celebrate Easter Sunday. The service, which was led by Bishop Elin Þórisdotra, included hymns, prayers, and a sermon on the resurrection of Christ. The cathedral was filled to capacity, with many attendees standing in the aisles and spilling out into the courtyard.

As of 2024, the Church of Hverland remains the largest religious denomination in the country, with over 80% of the population identifying as members. The Easter service at Hverhöfn Cathedral is one of the largest religious gatherings in the capital, drawing thousands of worshippers each year.
