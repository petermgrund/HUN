In the latest data release regarding religious affiliations in Hverland for the year 2024, the Church of Hverland managed to gain 1,990 members despite predictions of a decline. Experts had forecasted that 2024 would mark a historic first for the Church, expecting it to lose members for the first time after witnessing a marginal increase of just 210 members the previous year. The percentage of Hverlanders affiliated with the state church was anticipated to drop below 80%.

Contrary to these forecasts, however, the Church of Hverland's membership declined slightly from 80.94% in 2023 to 80.88% in 2024, not nearly as sharply as expected. Several factors are believed to have contributed to this unexpected steadiness. Higher than anticipated retention rates within the Church played a significant role, as well as lower levels of immigration alongside lower death rates.

The unaffiliated group grew by 427 members, marking a 0.10% increase in their proportion of the population. This was far less than expected by demographers at Statistics Hverland.

There was little movement in or out of other religions. The Catholic Church's membership increased by 75, and Eastern Orthodoxy saw an increase of 80 members. The Free Church in Hverhöfn added 17 members. Other Christians experienced a decline, losing 310 members.

Elin Þórisdotra, Bishop of the Church of Hverland, expressed gratitude and optimism regarding the increase in membership, stating, "We are deeply thankful for the growth in our congregation. This demonstrates the enduring appeal and relevance of our faith in the lives of Hverlanders. The addition of 1,990 members is a testament to the spiritual fulfillment we provide."

From the Catholic Church, a spokesperson commented, "The steady increase in our membership is a positive sign of our church's ongoing mission in Hverland. We remain committed to serving our community with compassion and dedication, welcoming all who seek guidance through our faith."

The Free Church in Hverhöfn shared a statement through their leader: "We are heartened by the growth of our community. Our journey from a small group of 56 members in 2000 to over 1,000 members today underscores the resonating message of our faith and the inclusive, community-focused approach we embody

A spokesperson from the Secular Society of Hverland reflected on the growth of the unaffiliated group, which saw an increase of 427 members. "This data underscores a growing trend towards secularism and non-religious identities among Hverlanders. It highlights the importance of acknowledging and supporting the diverse belief systems and values that exist in our society."
