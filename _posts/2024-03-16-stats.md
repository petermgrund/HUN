Earlier this week, the Church of Hverland released a policy statement on transhumanism and human enhancement. The document, titled "The Human Person and the Future of Technology," marks a significant departure from the church's previous stance on the issue, which was characterized by opposition to any form of bioenhancement. The statement, which was approved by the church's governing body, the Council of Bishops, acknowledges the potential benefits of transhumanism and human enhancement, but also says the church won't actively promote or endorse the practices at this time.

The policy statement is the result of a decade-long study conducted by the church's Theological Commission, which was tasked with examining the theological, ethical, and social implications of transhumanism and human enhancement. The commission consulted with experts in theology, bioethics, and technology, as well as with members of the church community, to develop the statement. The document is intended to provide guidance to church members and leaders on how to engage with these emerging technologies in a way that is consistent with the church's values and teachings.

The church has been declining in membership since the 1980's, when 9 in 10 Hverlanders identified as members of the church. Today, that number has dropped to just over 4 in 10. In 2016, the church dropped below 50% of the population for the first time in its history. It was this milestone that prompted the church to reevaluate its stance on transhumanism and human enhancement, as it sought to remain relevant in a society that is secularizing at an unprecedented rate.

"The church recognizes that transhumanism and human enhancement is at the forefront of Hverland's cultural and technological landscape," said Eirikur Hjaltsundr, Bishop of the Church of Hverland and chair of the Theological Commission. "We believe that it is important for the church to engage with these issues in a thoughtful and constructive way, rather than simply dismissing them out of hand. Our hope is that this policy statement will provide a framework for church members and leaders to navigate these complex issues with wisdom and discernment."

Some church members have expressed disappointment with the statement, arguing that the church should take a stronger stance against transhumanism and human enhancement. Leader of the United Christians Gorm Grasksundr said, "The church should be unequivocally opposed to these practices, which are a violation of God's design for humanity. By failing to condemn transhumanism, the church is sending the message that it is willing to compromise on its core values in order to appease the secular world."

Others have welcomed the document as a step in the right direction, saying that it shows the church is willing to engage with contemporary issues in a meaningful way. Others still have criticized the church for not going far enough, saying that it should have endorsed transhumanism and human enhancement outright. Leader of the Greens and Futurists Dahlia Snyggdotra said, "The church's policy statement is a step in the right direction, but it falls short of what is needed to address the challenges of the 21st century. We need a church that is willing to embrace the future, not one that is stuck in the past. The church should be leading the way on these issues, not lagging behind."
