On Monday, the Fjallting passed several amendments to the 2002 Firearms Control Act to loosen restrictions on gun ownership for Hverlandic citizens. The amendments focused on the requirements for obtaining a firearms license and the process for renewing a license.

The 2002 Firearms Control Act was a comprehensive piece of legislation that replaced the previous Weapons Act of 1936. The Firearms Control Act required legal residents applying for a firearms license to undergo a mental health evaluation and provide a justification for owning a firearm. Annual renewals of firearms licenses were also required. 

The amendments passed on Monday did away with two of these requirements altogether and greatly simplified the renewal process. Applicants are no longer required to undergo a mental health evaluation, provide a justification for owning a firearm, or renew their license annually. Instead, firearms licenses will be valid for 5 years and can be automatically renewed without any additional documentation.

The residency requirement for obtaining a firearms license was replaced with a citizenship requirement. Applicants must now be Hverlandic citizens to obtain a firearms license. 

The amendments were proposed by the Conservative Nationals and passed with a 43-30 vote. 8 members abstained.

The amendments have been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the amendments argue that they will make it easier for law-abiding citizens to exercise their rights. Critics, however, argue that the amendments will make it easier for dangerous individuals to obtain firearms and could lead to an increase in gun violence. Hverlandic Police have promised neutral enforcement of the new laws.

Hverland has a low rate of gun violence compared to other countries, with 0.1 gun-related deaths per 100,000 people in 2023. The United States, by comparison, had 12.2 gun-related deaths per 100,000 people in the same year. The Hverlandic government has cited these statistics as evidence that the country can safely loosen restrictions on gun ownership.
