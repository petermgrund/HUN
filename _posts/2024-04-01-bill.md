The Fjallting has passed a controversial bill that will impose stricter regulations on asylum seekers and refugees. The bill, which was introduced by the Conservative Nationals and supported by the Moderates and the Centre Party, has been met with criticism from human rights groups and opposition parties.

The bill passed 43-30 with 8 abstentions. It received unanimous support from the Conservative Nationals and the Moderates, while two members of the Centre Party defected to vote against it. The Social Democrats, The Greens, Urban Progressives, Alternative, and Albmotválgabealde all unanimously voted against the bill. Three members of the Liberals joined with the government parties in support, while 9 voted against and 1 abstained. Noteably, Liberals leader Björn Sigurðsson, who has been at odds with some members of his party over the bill, was one of the three party members to vote in favor of it.

Halldóra Jónsdóttir, leader of the Conservative Nationals, hailed the bill as a victory for Hverland. “This bill is a necessary step to protect our national interests and ensure the safety and security of our citizens,” she said. “We cannot afford to be naive about the challenges we face. The government has a duty to protect our borders and control who enters our country.” The Moderates leader Sigridur Björnsdóttir echoed these sentiments. 

The Greens leader Guðmundur Arnarson criticized the bill as “draconian” and “inhumane.” “This bill is a betrayal of our values and our commitment to human rights,” he said. “It sends a message to the world that Hverland is no longer a welcoming country.” The Social Democrats leader, who has been a vocal critic of the bill, called it “shameful” and “short-sighted.” 

The bill will come into effect on January 1, 2025.
