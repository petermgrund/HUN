The Government's *Digital Transition Act* was passed by the Thjodting today, with a vote of 58-23. The bill, which was introduced by the Liberals and Urban Progressives, mandates that starting in 2025, all government records must be created and stored in digital formats. The bill also allocates funds to transition all existing paper records to digital formats by 2026.

"We are pleased to see such strong support for this bill," said the bill's lead sponsor, newly elected Bethany McNeil. "This is an important step towards modernizing our government and making it more efficient and transparent." McNeil, the first American citizen to serve in the Thjodting, has made digital governance one of her top priorities. "In Minnesota, we have a saying: 'If it's not online, it doesn't exist.' I think that's a good rule to live by."

Leader of the Urban Progressives, Syg Hjorleyifsundr, said, "This bill is a win for all Hverlanders. It will make it easier for citizens to access government services and information, and it will save the government money in the long run." The bill also includes provisions to ensure that all government websites are accessible to people with disabilities, and that all government services are available online. "The city of Tyrvhuln has several rooms full of archives that are just collecting dust," said Syg. "This bill will help us to make better use of that space and to preserve our history for future generations."

The mayor of Tyrvhuln Vhendr Djarfsundr praised the bill, saying, "This is a great step forward for our city. We have been working towards a paperless government for years, but haven't had the resources to make it happen." Vhendr also noted that the bill will help to reduce the city's carbon footprint by eliminating the need for paper records.

The bill passed with unanimous support from the government parties, and received backing from some opposition members. Natural Balance leader Eyrune Marisioradotra said her party supported the bill because it aligns with the party's commitment to sustainability. "We believe that a digital government is a more efficient and accountable government," said Eyrune. "The projections are that this bill will save the government millions in the long run, and will help preserve the forests of Eyjateyja." Three members of A Nation to Preserve also supported the bill. 

The United Christians, Farmers and Fishers, and Community of the People voted against the bill, citing concerns about data security and privacy. "We are concerned that this bill will make it easier for the government to spy on its citizens," said United Christians leader Hjorundr Kjallarson. "Digitizing all records will create a massive database of personal information that could be vulnerable to hacking or misuse."

The bill will take effect on 1 January, 2025, with a deadline for full implementation by 1 January, 2026. The government has allocated 10 million for the transition, which will be overseen by the Office for Technology and Data Governance. The office will work with all government offices to ensure that they have the resources and support they need to make the transition. Jyorn Bjhrnasundr, Intendant for Data Governance and member of the <a href="{{ '/about/party/ks' | relative_url }}">Greens and Futurists</a>, said, "This represents one of the most significant changes to government operations in recent history. The people of Hverland will see the benefits of this bill for years to come."
